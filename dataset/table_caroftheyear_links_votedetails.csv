Austria,Horst Bauer,6,10,1,2,0,1,5,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/horst-bauer.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
An excellent handling car with a high-quality interior and one of the best MMI in the business. But what elevates the new 5-series over the rest is the multi-solution-approach in handling the complex requests of today's car-costumers. Whether it should be a BEV, a PHEV, a gasoline- or a diesel-engine, the 5-series is ready to deliver without compromises. Plus, with the i5 Touring, BMW broadens the electric portfolio for customers, looking for a premium-BEV with the versatility and the sleek silhouette of a sporty Station Wagon.
BYD Seal
The first truly Chinese car ever to enter the shortlist has the looks, the quality and the pricing, that makes it a worthy competitor to the established brands. Despite improvements in ride and handling since the first drive with pre-series cars, the Seal still has room for improvement in managing the overwhelming power of its electric drivetrain. Software-glitches compromising the MMI also detain the Seal from a higher spot in the ranking.
Kia EV9
A technological forerunner, the very well manufactured BEV is a great SUV. But the 7-Seater with its impressive wheelbase does not match with the dimensions of European roads and public parking. So the ""Technology Ambassador from Korea"" is not set to win the title like the EV6. But it nurtures the hope, some of its technology will trickle down soon to Kias with more ""European"" dimensions.
Peugeot 3008
What happened to the successor of the ""Car of the Year 2017""? Bigger in any dimensions, it turned form a sleek, agile and fashionable compact family car to a heavy BEV with an into-the face SUV-appearance. Thus compromising also the version with the hybrid-drivetrain, that itself does not have to carry the burden of delivering electric-drive-range-records. Strongest part of the new E-3008/3008 remains the excellent, user-friendly and well-designed interior.
Renault Scenic
The new Scenic proofs, that a modern BEV with a versatile, roomy interior, state-of-the-art battery- and drivetrain-technology with a sufficient range, does not necessarily have to be a high-rising SUV. Hitting the sweet spot between overall-weight and range, the new Scenic is a lot better suited to the challenges of the transition to electrified road-traffic, as the infrastructure in most markets is. Coming as a BEV-only therefore lifts the Scenic in my ranking to the Podium - but not to the top of it.
Toyota C-HR
The most accessible car in the shortlist, with a choice of PHEV and hybrid drivetrains including a 4WD-option, the new C-HR collects its points also with good handling and for not overshooting in dimensions and weight. Some inconsistency in packaging, like not offering the virtual gearchange-possibility for the E-CVT or no permanent-AWD-option for snowy road-conditions, prevent the C-HR of fully living up to the requirements of a young, agile and sporty Crossover, it tries to be.
Volvo EX30
The latest SUV from Volvo sports a sleek, modern design and drives great. But it betrays the heritage of the brand as a safety-forerunner. Providing driver-related information at the center-display only, not directly in the driver's field of view - with a HUD as non-option - is somehow disturbing. And providing the ""smallest SUV from Volvo"" with up to 315 kW / 428 PS maximum power also leaves one at a loss with the concept behind the EX30."
,Susanne Hofbauer,8,10,1,1,2,1,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/susanne-hofbauer.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
With the 5-series, BMW is exactly in tune with the times and has remained true to itself in important brand matters. The 5-series offers all forms of drivetrains on an equally emancipated level, from purely electric versions to diesel, with plug-in and hybrid versions in between, an estate is also available. Honoured above all else: the high technical level of the chassis, drive technology and operating details. This is how transformation works in all its maturity. Stability of value rules!
BYD Seal
I welcome the Seal as a refined statement from a Chinese brand on the European electric scene. On the plus side: independent stylistic identity, good building quality, a harmonious overall package, innovative battery technology and strong digital performance. Room for improvement: the chassis culture and more intuitive infotainment operation.
Kia EV9
The EV9 as the ambassador of the new Kia design has made a strong appearance. May Kia continue like this. Good qualities as a six- or seven-seater. Kia also deserves applause for its rapid development of vehicle-to-grid technology. With a length of over 5 metres, very large for Europe though.
Peugeot 3008
Where has Peugeot's understanding of elegance and sophisticated space solutions gone? The shape and technical features are too heavy for a model that aims to be ecologically exemplary. High weight due to large battery (98 kWh) in the pure electric model. The three-cylinder engine in the PHEV feels like an emergency solution. Great interior design tough, and fantastic seats.
Renault Scenic
If an electric model, then like this: Moderate in the important critical aspects of length (4.5 metres), weight (from 1750 kg), battery size (60 or 87 kWh), charging technology (max. 150 kW). Good looks. Good usability of everyday functions with refined modernized digital technology. Good space in the rear and boot, although we miss the old space miracle Scenic a little.
Toyota C-HR
Toyota also solidly lives its brand identity and value loyalty, in Japanese. Unique hybrid technology with a high level of technical seriousness, now as model C-HR in a new, slightly bolder, practical, and yet pleasing appearance. Some of the digital levels are a little awkward to operate. The CVT can learn from the Prius. Food for lovers of Japanese engineering.
Volvo EX30
The external appearance of the EX30 is a hit. Distinctive, clear design. No longer Volvo as we knew it before, but a good new line. In addition: compact length (4.23 m), reasonable battery sizes (51 or 69 kWh). But inside: everything, really everything, is only accessible via the central screen, from switching on the rear fog light to opening the glove compartment. Simplification as a misunderstanding."
,Dieter Hubmann,4,8,3,4,1,2,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/dieter-hubmann.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
For my point of view a worthy winner: driving dynamics, assistance systems, noise insulation - BMW is top in all areas. The only drawback: the price.
BYD Seal
A first, respectable appearance in the final. From design to software. But the Seal shows weaknesses in the driving dynamics. The traction control, for example, is not sensitive enough.
Kia EV9
The missing link to the future of e-mobility, for example when integrating it into the power supply of a house or apartment. These technology solutions need to be quickly installed in smaller vehicles.
Peugeot 3008
The strengths: interior design, new platform. The electric 3008 drives better than the hybrid, the electric version seems more stable. But: Tendency to roll, relatively loud on paving stones.
Renault Scenic
The strengths: comfort, quality, driving behavior. What is missing for first place? For example 800-volt-technology, so higher charging speeds would be possible.
Toyota C-HR
All known hybrid solutions in one car, the best alternative to an electric car. Top: plug-in hybrid. But: The small hybrid seems strained, the steering could basically be a little better.
Volvo EX30
The Volvo shows surprisingly good performance in terms of driving dynamics. But Volvo does not meet it's own requirements: In terms of safety, the speed display only in the middle screen is not sufficient."
Belgium,Joost Bolle,10,0,5,3,3,4,0,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/joost-bolle.php?1726491866,"BMW 5-series
The 5-series has the advantage of being available with various propulsion modes. Moreover, the i5 is one of the best-driving EVs on the market. However, I find it unattainable for too many people due to its price tag and, therefore, not eligible for the title of 'Car of the Year.'
BYD Seal
The Seal is a pleasant car for long distances, especially on excellent roads. However, its suspension doesn't provide the comfort level of sister model 'Seal U' on poorer roads, which are quite common in my country. In addition to a few practical issues (adjusting ventilation slots via a touch menu...), I find this a reason not to place it at number one.
Kia EV9
The KIA EV9 drives surprisingly well for an electric car of its size and weight. An excellent choice for those looking for a model in the large SUV category. However, it is not 'all-round' enough to qualify for what, in my opinion, should be a Car of the Year.
Peugeot 3008
The 3008 was certainly a contender for the first place, in my view. Excellent choice to offer it with both a gasoline engine next to the electric version. The reason I didn't place it in the top spot is due to the price of the electric version. When comparing it to the Scenic, as a rational consumer, one will undoubtedly choose the significantly cheaper Renault.
Renault Scenic
This year, Coty had seven strong finalists. However, considering all aspects, the Renault Scenic ticks the most boxes, while the other models have at least one shortcoming. The Scenic is well-finished, drives well, offers plenty of interior space, and is notably comfortable compared to many EVs. But most of all: its attractive price can play a role in popularizing EVs as family cars.
Toyota C-HR
The C-HR is a fun car but not practical. It has a small trunk and an awkwardly designed interior. It mainly targets an audience seeking a trendy car, willing to make concessions in practical use. Furthermore, it is priced high for what essentially is just a city car and not enough 'all round' as a Car of the Year should be in my opinion.
Volvo EX30
The Volvo has one 'no-go' aspect: no instrument panel that at least tells you how fast you are driving. For that, you have to look at the central touch screen to the right of the driver. In a Europe with increasingly more speed limits, this takes your gaze away from the direction of travel. A pity. Without this issue, I would definitely have given many more points to this nice car."
,Stéphane Lemeret,7,1,4,3,3,2,5,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/stephane-lemeret.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
I've always liked BMWs, and this one is not a bad BMW. But I am extremely disappointed that the overall ergonomics of the new 5-series are much less intuitive and logical than those of previous BMWs. This harsh vote is intended to wake up the brand's ergonomics managers.
BYD Seal
This first Chinese car among the COTY finalists is impressive. But I would never buy this model due to some completely idiotic ergonomic details, like the inability to orient the ventilation vents as you want. Too bad, but BYD will surely come back even stronger next time!
Kia EV9
This proposal from Kia is very interesting and doesn't have many competitors on the market. But I remain convinced that such a heavy, bulky, and consuming electric car doesn't make much sense. Moreover, the EV9 uses the technology of the EV6 elected two years ago, which didn't motivate me to give it more points. But it's a very good car.
Peugeot 3008
Peugeot has chosen to offer a very long range to its E-3008. This will obviously please a category of buyers, but with a base version well exceeding 2 tons, the electric 3008 falls into a 'heavyweight' category that is difficult to endorse, especially since the price also reflects it. Fortunately, there is a hybrid version, which is very interesting.
Renault Scenic
This new Renault combines the most qualities and the fewest flaws among the 7 finalists of 2024. The compromise of range-weight-price is excellent and perfectly meets the market demands, at least in Belgium. I also appreciate the ergonomics of the Scenic, and the possibility to disconnect (with a simple button) all driving aids, mandatory but annoying.
Toyota C-HR
It's a bit of my crush among the 2024 finalists. Certainly, this C-HR is not available in EV, which becomes problematic (especially in Belgium), but this car is the liveliest and most enjoyable to drive in the 2024 selection. A subjective vote, but a refreshing one!
Volvo EX30
How can a manufacturer so reputed for safety market a car with such a dangerous ergonomics? There isn't even a speedometer in line with the road: everything goes through the central screen! Shameful cost-cutting, which doesn't prevent the EX30 from being a good electric car otherwise. But why not offer a less powerful and cheaper version?"
Czech Republic,Jiri Duchon,4,7,4,3,3,2,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/jiri-duchon.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
The latest ""5er"" confirms its reputation as a traditional showcase of technical progress combined with everyday usability. Although the G60 will not offer as cozy driver's workplace as before, everything will be enhanced by a wide and finely-tuned range of engines, from the economical four-cylinder ""diesel"" to the fantastic plug-in hybrid 550e and excellent i5 with full electric drive.
BYD Seal
Historically, it's the first car from a Chinese brand to make it to the final of the COTY contest! It's a great electric car. With rich equipment and first-class workmanship, it stands out. On the racetrack, it outperforms European competitors with its ability to accelerate repeatedly and without showing signs of decreasing battery capacity. However, there may be a need for fine-tuning in corner exits.
Kia EV9
The EV9 is an impressive luxury electric car, accommodating up to seven passengers, exhibiting remarkable stability and ferocity even on the test race circuit. With its large battery, rich equipment, and excellent driving characteristics, it stands out in the realm of electric traction vehicles. It appears that self-confident Chinese can be actually scared only by Koreans...
Peugeot 3008
The first car built on the new STLA Medium platform! The electric E-3008 offers a decent range, but the weight of much over two tons is noticeable at every start and in every corner. Fortunately, the Stellantis with the STLA platform keeps the back door open in case complete electrification fails: the new platform also allows the installation of internal combustion engines.
Renault Scenic
A larger relative of the Megane E-Tech from the COTY 2022 final. It offers a spacious and welcoming interior. There is also plenty of space and smart solutions in the back seats. Could it be the first European family electric car? Quite possibly! Its lightweight and efficient construction contributes to its long range. Unfortunately, the engine is only in the front. And it's electric only...
Toyota C-HR
It has a playful feel, but it is a car where practicality has given way to looks. You cannot see to the sides from the rear seats and the large rear window lacks a wiper. The internal combustion engine is noisy and the transmission contributes to an unpleasant acoustic feel. Why didn't the Prius make it to the COTY 2024 finals? It is significantly better car in every way...
Volvo EX30
This Volvo is manufactured in China, but next year, as part of Volvo's comprehensive reduction of CO2 emissions, its assembly for Europe is set to begin in Belgium. Parent company Geely's proven all-electric platform is lightweight and powerful, produced in significant quantities, resulting in a favourable selling price. The interior is environmentally friendly and pleasant to the touch."
Denmark,Søren W. Rasmussen,6,9,5,1,2,1,1,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/soren-rasmussen.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
This car is well designed both from the outside and in any technical aspect. As full-electric it drives extremely well and adds a set of very good-working assistant systems that provide the driver with a higher level of safety than usual for a new car. Other variants such as the Touring in combination with electric drivelines, diesel, and hybrids make the car relevant in almost all markets.
BYD Seal
Seal is in many ways an extremely encouraging experience. The interior impresses with both the fine assembly quality and the many smart solutions such as several screens around the driver's seat. BYD has had such a great desire to create a lightning-fast car that can beat all the competitors that driving comfort has taken a back seat. But still an impressive entry for BYD in this year's competition for Car of the Year.
Kia EV9
EV9 appears as a showcase for Korea's automotive industry, and it is very impressive to experience in practice. The car is well equipped and, in every way, a big car. The driving experience is fine on large roads, but in everyday life, the car still feels too big, and this can be a problem for some car owners.
Peugeot 3008
3008 is an impressive car that marks a new era for the brand. The car's design, cockpit layout, and driving experience have all been elevated to new heights, making it a standout option among its peers. While the electric version is especially attractive, the hybrid versions are less remarkable.
Renault Scenic
Now Renault is back as a leading BEV brand. Scenic combines in a very convincing way the traditional Scenic qualities such as extremely good space in the second row with a very fine driving experience. Furthermore, the Scenic comes with two battery sizes, allowing owners to prioritize either range or affordability. All of these attributes make the Scenic a standout vehicle.
Toyota C-HR
Toyota is known for letting the C-HR play with the design, and this applies not least to this new generation. However, I would have liked to see the car as a BEV instead of the current powertrains, which work well but seem to point more backward than forward.
Volvo EX30
The new mini-Volvo is a fine mini-SUV with many good features and not least a very nice design. But I am a bit disappointed by the gaps between this model and the many other Volvo models that usually impress with user-oriented layouts and better spaciousness. Here the EX30 lacks the usual Volvo touch."
Finland,Velimatti Honkanen,5,7,3,4,2,1,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/velimatti-honkanen.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
BMW 5-series has managed to be faithful to its 50 year long tradition. The new generation is the best available compromise including almost all different powertrains - only fuel cell is missing. The electric i5 is very silent and comfortable, and so is the diesel. The i5 is excellent also in winter conditions. The Touring version brings even more options. On the wish list still remains some more rear legroom and a more simple HMI.
BYD Seal
BYD Seal is the first Chinese brand in the COTY final. The car is clearly a competitor to Tesla Model 3 and does many things great. The perceived quality is high and the performance is excellent. However, several areas still need attention: the center area of the steering feels synthetic, rear seat comfort is compromised and the menus in the touch screen are somewhat confusing.
Kia EV9
Kia EV9's futuristic design and large size steal attention in any car group. It gives ample space even for seven passengers and does not have many competitors with electric powertrain. Charging speed is impressive even in winter conditions thanks to the 800-volt electrical architecture. In order to keep the price reasonable the car has no four-wheel steering nor air suspension. Thus EV9 is a bit stiff in city blocks and the suspension comfort, especially in cold conditions, does not match the appearance.
Peugeot 3008
Like BMW also Peugeot relies on a multi-energy platform. The new 3008 is the first car with the new STLA Medium architecture. It is a reasonable car both in terms of space and features, but in many respects it is not superior to its competitors. Considering the brand new architecture, the E-3008 is quite heavy weighing 200 kg more than its main competitor Renault Scenic. The upcoming version with 700 km range is interesting and also the all-wheel drive and PHEV versions give more options.
Renault Scenic
The new electric Renault Scenic is rather a Grand Megane than an MPV that Scenic has been known as. There are no adjustments in the rear seats and no seven-seater is planned. But after you stop thinking about the old Scenic, the new one is a very nice car. It is lower, more agile and more driver oriented than the Peugeot 3008. Rear seat is roomy but the comfort is not optimal. The trunk is large but deep with a limited practicality.
Toyota C-HR
The first Toyota C-HR was an example that Toyota knows how to make also other than boring cars. The sales figures showed that there is need for this second generation, which is even more oriented to the European customers. Now the C-HR is for the first time available as a plug-in hybrid, which is also more pleasant to drive and more quiet than the basic hybrid version. The handling is good, compact size makes it nimble and it is also the most affordable car among the finalists.
Volvo EX30
The EX30 is some kind of a ""Volvo Light"" because obviously due to the challenging target price it has given up some of the basic safety aspects that Volvo has been famous for. There is no instrument cluster nor head-up display (even if the other brands with same Geely SEA architecture have them), no large animal detection and the user interface is complex. Rear seat is very tight and uncomfortable. The suspension comfort is not perfect but the handling is fine. The AWD version has strange delay in front motor clutch which is quite unpleasant in slippery conditions."
France,Christophe Bourroux,9,2,8,1,1,2,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/christophe-bourroux.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
A great car with a fantastic experience driver. The 5-series with impressive performance and driving range and technologically Advanced vehicles. Some very advanced technology such as the highway overtaking system but the price-quality ratio is too high to be designated as a general public car.
BYD Seal
Good autonomy, good value for money. A serious competitor to the Tesla 3. Among its faults: too long a charging time, or even a still weak distribution network
Kia EV9
Car which has the advantage of accommodating many passengers in super comfort. Impeccable driving. But its XXL dimension makes it too imposing to concern a maximum of motorists.
Peugeot 3008
Handling that remains in Peugeot's DNA, driving as pleasant as ever with the small steering wheel, better positioned so that you don't have to worry about seeing the road with the I-Cockpit. Record autonomy for the category in its most powerful version, but which will translate into a higher price.
Renault Scenic
Size, autonomy, driving. The Scenic ticks all the boxes for a family who wants to drive electric in a car that offers good autonomy and very appreciable driving comfort. It corrects all the early flaws of the Megane Etch while bringing modernity such as the blackout roof and many tips for life on board. A good ""popular"" electric car for family.
Toyota C-HR
Compact, efficient and easy to drive for the majority of customers. But the model, even if it improves, does not offer an advance compared to the previous version
Volvo EX30
Even if the car offers serious advantages, such as safety, it does not bring anything really new to the market. Nothing original that would deserve to be distinguished. Especially the interior ultra minimalist with limited storage capacity for the trunk."
,Florence Lagarde,5,10,4,3,0,0,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/florence-lagarde.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Agile and precise, despite its weight and dimensions, the BMW 5-series is a vehicle that is a real pleasure to drive. In terms of comfort, technology and infotainment, it offers the best on the market, if you can afford it. A classic, elegant saloon in a world dominated by SUVs, the BMW 5-series renews the genre and preserves the best of automotive tradition. As the brand has never won this distinction, rewarding the 5-series would fill a gap.
BYD Seal
The BYD Seal is a dynamic car as are all electric cars. As the manufacturer is first and foremost a battery manufacturer, the vehicle is at the top of its class in terms of consumption. I'd criticise it for being relatively bland and insipid, I find it lacking in charm, I didn't like the feel of the materials or the very tortured dashboard. I think that before it can be named Car of the Year, the brand needs depth and image, as well as customer feedback, to really form an idea of what it's worth.
Kia EV9
The Kia EV9 is one of the most interesting vehicles of this edition in terms of the match between the proposal and the realisation. In addition to its appealing exterior design, the interior layout is particularly well executed, with all seats, including the third row, treated with care. Comfort, ergonomics and connectivity are of the highest order. The lounge configuration with two swivel seats in the second row is particularly interesting.
Peugeot 3008
The Peugeot 3008 has the advantages and disadvantages of a multi-energy platform with a choice of internal combustion and electric engines. Compared with the Scenic, this choice results in a longer and wider vehicle, with less space in the rear seats. Despite its weight, the E-3008 is a dynamic, comfortable car that is great fun to drive. The design of its e-cockpit remains one of its strong points.
Renault Scenic
""Thanks to a platform dedicated to electric propulsion, the Renault Scenic is a compact vehicle with excellent interior space. I very much appreciated its liveliness, its dynamic road holding, the quality of the materials, the warm atmosphere and the functionalities of the multimedia system developed with Google, which remains one of the most efficient on the market. Renault has also made a serious effort on the price front, with prices starting (in France) at €39,990 for a range of up to 430 km and €46,990 for a range of up to 625 km.
Toyota C-HR
The Toyota C-HR is not available in an electric version but in four hybrid powertrains, including a rechargeable hybrid that offers a range of up to 66 km, which in this period of transition is an excellent compromise. Toyota deserves a lot of credit for having dared to take the distinctive design that made the previous generation so successful a step further. I liked the organization of the controls, the ergonomics of the central computer and its driving behavior.
Volvo EX30
The Volvo EX30 disappointed me with its interior architecture. I felt that the choices were made with profitability in mind rather than the customer in mind. The quality of finish and materials is not at the premium level that we have seen in other models from the brand. The decision to bring all the functions together on a central tablet has been taken to extremes: all the controls, including the glovebox release, are on the screen and there's no head-up display either."
,Guy L'Hospital,7,4,5,3,3,1,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/guy-lhospital.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
With its multi-energy platform, the BMW 5-series offers a wide range of versions. The 100% electric i5 model makes no compromises, either in terms of driving pleasure or in terms of performance, but the price is not within the reach of everyone. At this price, an 800-volt architecture for faster charging would have been welcome. I'd also like to see less complex ergonomics and rear-seat space worthy of the best electric cars in the category.
BYD Seal
This Tesla rival has a lot of good qualities. Starting with its precise handling, (maybe too reactive on a small bumpy road...), the Seal is fun to drive particularly with the 390 kW four-wheel drive version. The rear passenger space is correct but the boot isn't practical. Above all, it's not been sold at a competitive price. It lacks a trip planner witch is a major drawback for a car designed for long journeys. It has a good range, but the charging power is limited to a 150 kW.
Kia EV9
The different awards won by the Kia EV9 across the Atlantic prove the value of this big SUV, which keep people either love or hate. Its 800-volt architecture makes it easy to charge its large 100 kWh battery. However, its range is only 300 km on the motorway because it is heavy. The materials and assembly are of high quality and it has a good interior space and it is very adaptable. However, this is a niche product for the European market.
Peugeot 3008
It has been created to seduce the driver with its streamlined styling and dashboard topped by a large curved screen. The new 3008 boasts a good range that means motorway journeys need minimal planning. Most importantly, Peugeot hallmark driving precision is still here. However, it is heavy and this has an impact on performance and driving pleasure. The backseats are also cramped. We can't wait for the 5008. Thanks for the 8-year warranty.
Renault Scenic
There are two ways of understanding the Renault Scenic. Firstly as a Megane E-Tech +, secondly as a pleasant, comfortable car with enough range to become the main family car. This is how I would position it. I particularly liked the trip planner, the ergonomics, the glass roof and the excellent voice control. Above all, the lightweight could be an advantage for this electric cars in the future.
Toyota C-HR
There is no doubt that the new C-HR will be a success in the European market. It has improved its driving precision and comfort from the previous model. However, il has the same weaknesses : small passenger and boot space, irritating alerts with are note easy to stop. The two full hybrids are unpleasant to drive on the motorway or in the mountains and the PHEV is expensive.
Volvo EX30
This little SUV is full of charm with a simple dashboard. However, it is difficult to use as it needs some compromises. For example, it's difficult to keep the navigation screen in front of you if you want to do something else on the car's single screen. Fuel consumption is higher than hoped and the range in real traffic conditions is less than 350 km. In France, without price incentives, the price/performance ratio isn't so attractive."
,Yves Maroselli,6,5,5,2,3,1,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/yves-maroselli.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
The BMW 5-series is a premium sedan/wagon offering a highly enjoyable driving experience and a very wide range of powertrains (mHEV, PHEV or BEV, from 208 to 601 hp). The 550e plug-in hybrid for example combines in an almost perfect manner pure electric propulsion for urban commuting with a powerful 6 cylinder for the road. It is also safe and agile thanks to its four wheel steering system.
BYD Seal
The Seal offers a lot for its price: It looks nice, has a very decent range and a brighter and roomier interior than most of the competition. Its build quality is good but doesn't really feel premium. It is also very heavy and can't charge as fast as its main rivals. Finally, the car's dynamics are disappointing on uneven or rough roads.
Kia EV9
The EV9 is excellent for a family of 7. Its impressive range ensures that family vacations are within reach, especially when the route includes fast chargers, where the EV9 can replenish its battery at an impressive rate (up to 210 kW). However, in practical terms, this Korean SUV seems oversized for the European road network, making parking and maneuvering challenging in many city centers.
Peugeot 3008
The Peugeot 3008 offers versatility with options for mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric models. While the interior boasts an appealing design, it may not deliver the spaciousness one might anticipate from an SUV of its size. The 3008 carries a considerable weight, noticeable during driving, as it lacks the agility typically associated with the Peugeot brand.
Renault Scenic
The newest Scenic has emerged as a highly capable electric crossover. Its impressive roominess-to-size ratio, paired with a notable range of up to 625 km, positions it as a practical option for daily commutes and extended vacation trips. Additionally, by the end of the year, the Scenic will introduce V2G capability, offering the potential for its owner to significantly reduce electricity costs.
Toyota C-HR
The Toyota C-HR looks even bolder than its predecessor and is now available in a 223 hp PHEV version, providing a pure electric range suitable for most daily commutes. While efficient, it falls short in delivering a particularly enjoyable driving experience. Rear visibility has improved but still poses challenges, and the navigation of infotainment and driving aids menus can be complex.
Volvo EX30
The EX30 is a powerful and fun to drive electric urban SUV. It comes at a premium price but lacks the build quality and some equipment like a Head-Up Display (HUD) or instrument panel you could expect from a brand like Volvo. The innovative human-machine interface can be challenging for the driver to read and comprehend and the car offers less legroom for rear passengers than some of its rivals."
,Stèphane Meunier,7,3,6,2,3,2,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/stephane-meunier.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Not everybody needs a 5 meters long sedan. And less may afford a BMW 5-series with a 62 800€ entry level price. Also, its more modest versions (petrol 520i and diesel 520d) convince more with fuel efficiency and smooth riding than enjoying handling or upper class finish. But the upper versions like the 550e L6 PHEV or the electric i5 M60 are incredible Jekyll & Hyde machines that easily defeat its E-Class rivals. Something MB did not allow before
BYD Seal
After driving the Atto 3 and Dolphin, L'Automobile's team was not expected much from the Seal. But testing both the 4WD and the cheaper rear wheel drive version were nice surprises. This BYD does all you expect from a Model 3 without imposing the Tesla's quirky interface and poor finish. But the Chinese sedan has few dealers in France and can't rely on a dedicated fast charging network. Also, the very soft damping rebound should be tweaked.
Kia EV9
Hyper roomy, versatile as a MPVs before, the EV9 is also full of clever details that will make its 5 or 6 passengers happy. The driver is not hapless as the driving is pleasant regarding weight and size of this EV. But this Kia appears better suited for hotel shuttle purpose than the perfect « big family » car role because of electricity refill on long distance and entry price (78 000 euros) despite being cheaper than the competition.
Peugeot 3008
It's smart that the 3008 offers both mild hybrid/plug-in engines an full electric (front wheel drive/4WD, 73 or 98 kWh). But it also leads to a very heavy car : 170 extra kilos on the hybrid e-DCS6 vs. today ! About 2183 kg for the E-3008 73 kWh. Yes, engineers did their best to hide it on the steering wheel. And riding/silence is improved as the new dashboard is both spectacular and convenient. But rear room is limited and agility is no more the 3008's credo.
Renault Scenic
Driving the new Scenic 87 kWh is half surprise as it is linked to the convincing Megane E-tech. Same IHM and efficient trip planner, same kind of engine and a huge dealers network with a 1st rate after-sale service. But the other half of the Scenic is very consistent : bigger and more efficient battery, competitive prices, enough room for a family and luggage and still a very good balance between comfort and handling. At last, a very capable EV.
Toyota C-HR
The new C-HR retains everything that made its predecessor successful: bold design, hybrid engines -even more efficient- and a 3 year warranty. Interior, trims and riding have improved. Driving is pleasing despite intrusive ADAS and complicated menus. Also rear passengers should again not be demanding. But above all, among the Toyotas in this 2024 COTY election, the Prius appears even more relevant.
Volvo EX30
Volvo rising came mainly from its cozy interiors, good comfort and clever IHM with safety and practicality in mind. Exterior design was also an asset, something the EX30 took advantage in 4,23m. Also its driving can be cool to sporty but depending on models, riding goes from firm to correct. Also quirky interface, different bugs, cheap plastics, wind noises and poor rear leg room turn this EX30 into an incomplete EV despite premium prices."
,Sylvain Reisser,7,6,5,3,1,1,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/sylvain-reisser.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Admittedly, the BMW 5-series is not for everyone, but it fully deserves second place in my ranking because it is undoubtedly the most pleasant to drive, regardless of the engine, and undoubtedly the finalist with the most technology. BMW really masters its subject even with the electric versions. The 5-series lets you choose the energy that suits you best : diesel, petrol, plug-in hybrid, and pure electric.
BYD Seal
The poster is enticing : a well-designed line, a finish and materials in the average of the segment, more than respectable power and performance. In use, the BYD Seat admits its limitations. Beyond disappointing charging performance, I consider that the road handling is far from being up to par. At high speeds, the driver may be surprised by unpredictable oversteer.
Kia EV9
With the EV9, we find most of the characteristics of the EV6 sedan elected Car of the year, but due to its size, this large electric SUV that can accommodate up to 7 people is not made for the European markets. In addition, its overall prestation are of high quality.
Peugeot 3008
The new 3008 leaves me with a mixed impression. You don't have the feeling of novelty like you had with the older generation. The performance is of high quality, but the pleasure suffers from too much weight and the ergonomics of the new i-cockpit can always be improved, in our opinion.
Renault Scenic
By awarding the best score to the Renault Scenic, I wanted to reward the manufacturer's work. In addition to its particularly competitive quality/price ratio, there is remarkable comfort and particularly satisfactory performance, both in terms of weight control, fun to drive, autonomy and charging times. It's clear that the Scenic has been developed on an electric platform.
Toyota C-HR
Underneath a spectacular look, the C-HR doesn't present a revolution. It is simply an evolution of the concept that now has the merit of being offered in a plug-in hybrid version. Driving pleasure with the 1.8- and 2-litre hybrid versions still has to cope with the runaway engine.
Volvo EX30
Is it still a Volvo? The question arises. In the end, the promise of driving a ""premium"" car is not kept. The price is high for such a small size and an interior quality that does not meet Volvo standards and ergonomics that has succumbed to the Tesla syndrome. Rather than going for the power that is useless on a vehicle of this vocation, Volvo should have taken care of the prestation on board."
Germany,Holger Appel,4,10,0,3,5,0,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/holger-appel.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Excellent and safe driving behavior, Bavaria obviously has a top-professional handling department and they are still taking care of. Quality on highest level. Vast variety of models and engines, including Touring and EV. Innovative, sporty, comfortable, and yes, expensive, but worth it. By far the best car in this years final.
BYD Seal
I like the design outside, not so much inside. Quality seems to be okay. I was surprised by the tricky behavior on the test circuit. Due to light rain the surface was slippery, the BYD reacted nervous while accelerating and even more on the brakes. Steering is indifferent. I lost confidence on higher speeds. Too many warn signs, the permanent ding-dong drives you crazy. To be in the Final is a huge success for BYD, but this is not (yet) a car of the year.
Kia EV9
A brave car. Roominess is excellent, the Design attractive. Usable without mystery. Drives safe and comfortable, but the cabin shakes like a boat in tight corners. Drivetrain maybe to weak for the heavy weight. Should have a four wheel steering. Too many warnings. Consumption is high. I like the EV 9.
Peugeot 3008
CEO Linda Jackson says: Customer first. Okay, if the customer wants just another SUV (Coupé), fair enough. It drives comfortable, although you feel in every moment the weight of up to 2,2 tons. In the driver seat, you rather sit on the car than in the car. I don't see any innovation, in fact, I don't understand this 3008. Peugeot had and, i am sure, will have better ideas.
Renault Scenic
Renault took anything away what made a Scenic a Scenic. The complete loss of Monospaces in the model range is a mistake. Besides the lack of modularity, the new Scenic is the better Mégane. It is roomy with much space around the two usable back seats. Driving is effortless, comfortable and safe. It is much lighter than the Peugeot, the Renault fits pretty well in every day use. Some material look and feel too dreary. EV cars are never cheap, this one seems to be an attractive offer.
Toyota C-HR
A huge argument for the Toyota is its price. It is affordable, Quality is typical Japanese level. The idea of the hybrid is good, but driving with it outside the city is not so funny. PHEV drives better, but more expensive, and does the concept has a future? Besides, a C-HR like a C-HR, with dynamic design. No possibility to see anything backwards. I like the Toyota, but it is probably not the most attractive car in the final.
Volvo EX30
The concept is the most positive surprising one in the field, the outside design awesome. On the other hand: Interior with only one iPad for every information in the middle is not at all practical and not at all safe. Difficult to use. Driving behavior is fine, but the car feels basically like a Chinese EV and is maximum half a Volvo. Some material look an touch like reused crispbread. Even considering the climate argument: Just less of everything is probably not enough for a brand like Volvo with its history. Nevertheless i felt well and relaxed while cruising, the EX 30 seems to be an attractive city solution. Expensive."

BMW 5-series
Brilliant car that drives great and remains efficient despite its size
BYD Seal
Interesting car with an innovative battery, but some weaknesses. Especially when it comes to driving stability and therefore driving safety
Kia EV9
Very spacious, modern, good comfort and driving characteristics - just too big and therefore not very efficient
Peugeot 3008
A big, safe driving car. A bit limited space in relation to the size and ergonomic weaknesses
Renault Scenic
Very pleasant and comfortable car to drive. Spacious - but not as versatile as the old one.
Toyota C-HR
Efficient drive train - but the new Prius would have been the better choice for the shortlist
Volvo EX30
Pretty and modern car with soft, comfortable suspension. However, I miss some typical Volvo strengths, for example in terms of usability and steering feel."
,Hanno Boblenz,5,10,5,1,4,0,0,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/hanno-boblenz.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Combustion engine and electric, saloon and estate, top chassis, dynamics and comfort - BMW takes the 5-series to a new level and offers solutions for all requirements in one model. Outstanding for me: operation, infotainment and everything to do with HMI. Full points as I want to pick one winner
BYD Seal
For me personally, the Seal is too much. Sure, the drive and load behavior are perfectly ok, but the Chinese still have some catching up to do when it comes to the chassis, steering and tuning of the driving assistants.
Kia EV9
No question, a great car: spacious, easy to operate, good performance, quick to charge. But in my eyes too big to make it onto the podium at Car of the Year.
Peugeot 3008
Very convincing modular platform. Great: the new i-Cockpit. For the size of the car, however, the amount of space doesn't quite convince me. +: 22 kw charging
Renault Scenic
Convinces me above all with its outstanding spaciousness. A good offer in the most sought-after segment and balanced in all characteristics. + charging with 22 kW as standard.
Toyota C-HR
Toyota can do economical drives, but the concept of the C-HR doesn't make sense to me, even in the second generation: why have a back seat if you're sitting there like in a cave? If it were the new Prius, it would have scored points with me.
Volvo EX30
I'm a fan of Scandinavian design, which is why I think the Volvo looks very good. Great: the woolen fabric look and the approach of using sustainable materials wherever possible. But in terms of operation (HMI) and driving performance, the small car simply overshoots the mark."
,Stefan Cerchez,3,9,3,3,4,1,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/stefan-cerchez.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
A car that stands out - from the other finalists, but also in its segment. Handling, agility and comfort rank among the best you can get for your money, and although that means a lot of money, the 5-series is worth it. Be it the efficient 520d, the dynamic 550e or the fully electric i5: With its new multi-drive platform BMW raises the bar once more - although we do miss the i-drive controller.
BYD Seal
First impression: A nicely designed and well-riding car with spacious interior. Also very fast, but its chassis does not fit the powerful drivetrain. Brakes and suspension (including stability control) need some readjustment to match the performance potential. Menus and Apps don't make effective use of the large swiveling touchscreen.
Kia EV9
The Koreans show how far they can go with their E-GMP-Platform. In case of the EV9 that gets you an enormously big, heavy and powerful electric SUV with an WLTP-Range of almost 500 Kilometers. That said, it's still two inches shorter than the BMW, but seats up to seven! So it might actually be the perfect electric family car for some people - if they can spare around 80.000 Euro.
Peugeot 3008
As the BMW, the new 3008 is available with well driving electric and mild-hybrid-powertrains, which all fit the STLA-Medium platform. In relation to its size and shape, the 3008 turns out to be quite spacious and has a well-crafted interior. The i-cockpit (steering wheel below instruments) is still not made for everyone, but usability is better than in previous versions.
Renault Scenic
The new all electric Scenic is, well, not a Scenic anymore. Renault kept the well-established nameplate, but dropped many practical features that made the Scenic special before. Then again, its lighter compared to the E-3008 and offers loads of trunk and interior space, even though it's a bit shorter than its French rival.
Toyota C-HR
First of all, the new C-HR is NOT a bad car - it drives like a Toyota should, is economical, right-sized and still affordable. But then it's just the second-generation C-HR, with no major changes in concept or technology. Nothing wrong with that - sales figures indicate that Toyota should indeed stay with that recipe.
Volvo EX30
A Volvo unlike any other Volvo so far! Fully electric, compact, and affordable - well, sort of. Yes, it does some things differently and we're not so sure about the lacking dials for the driver (only a central screen). But its fast, rides well and quite comfortable. The EX 30 is simply an attractive addition to the compact segment."
,Frank Mertens,4,8,3,1,5,2,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/frank-mertens.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Not everyone wants to drive purely electrically. That's why BMW also offers the 5-series as a classic combustion engine and plug-in hybrid alongside the i5. But once you've driven the i5, that's all you want to do. The overall package is excellent: the efficiency is outstanding, the power delivery is sporty, the chassis is beyond criticism. The quality of the interior is premium - which also applies to the price. The Touring will coming soon.
BYD Seal
The Seal looks stylish and is well made. This puts him on a par with the competition. This also applies to the performance of the E-Motors. On the positive side, the 82 kWh lithium iron phosphate battery does not contain any cobalt, nickel or cadmium. The suspension tuning, however, is not very convincing: on the road, it still feels harmonious, but when driving fast on the test track, it is very spongy/unprecise. Too bad.
Kia EV9
The EV9 is from a technical point of view top. Its almost 100 kWh battery provides sufficient range and its 800 volt architecture ensures fast charging. The interior offers space for up to seven people with a high degree of variability. This makes it an ideal car for families. However, its length of five meters, its width of almost two meters (!) and a weight of at least 2.5 tons no longer fit into a time when space in cities is becoming increasingly limited.
Peugeot 3008
In the electric version of the Peugeot 3008, there is no need to worry about range; you can drive up to 700 kilometers electrically. There is also a smaller battery to choose from; it is more than sufficient, also due to the good charging performance. The interior with its new i-Cockpit and large curved display looks good, the driving performance leaves nothing to be desired, and the 3008 is available with all-wheel drive and as a hybrid version.
Renault Scenic
The new model no longer has much in common with the original Scenic. It is more like a larger Megané. Nevertheless, it is a good vehicle for families looking for space. The Scenic offers an appealing interior with a high feel-good factor. The drive and range are just as impressive as the efficiency and attractive price. The French have also placed great emphasis on sustainability. Only the charging capacity could be higher.
Toyota C-HR
If you are looking for a car with an expressive design, the C-HR is the right choice. It is not a mainstream model. However, this takes its toll with limited space in the rear. At the same time, visibility to the rear is restricted. When driving, the CVT gearbox is annoying with its background noise; the PHEV is more superior. Ultimately, the Toyota offers too few innovations, and the price is also quite high.
Volvo EX30
The EX30 is compact, powerful and pursues a consistent sustainability approach. Its driving dynamics are impressive in everyday use and at a sporty pace. The fact that there is only one display in the center of the dashboard is irritating. The same applies to the window openers on the center console. The space in the rear is manageable. An attractive entry-level price also speaks for the EX30."
Greece,Helen Xenakis,3,3,5,2,7,1,4,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/helen-xenakis.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
In my opinion, the current 5-series is the best ever and undoubtedly the finest car in its class. It can easily compete with models in the higher class (in terms of cost as well), as it is loaded with advanced technology and is also quite spacious. Due to its size, it may not be suitable for everyday use, and as a result, it prioritizes comfort over driving pleasure, which is a first for the 5-series.
BYD Seal
BYD, like other Chinese manufacturers, is expanding its presence in Europe by offering a range of high-tech and cost-effective vehicles. However, with competition from both Tesla and Korean automakers, the BYD Seal faces a challenging task. Although it is a well-rounded vehicle, it falls behind its competitors in areas such as road handling and design, which is reminiscent of cars that have been on the market for several years.
Kia EV9
The EV9 is not only about technology; it is highly versatile, offering options for five to seven seats. It comes well-equipped as standard and has an impressive range. However, it can be expensive when compared to some of the more luxurious competitors. Additionally, the ride can sometimes be less smooth due to its large wheels being unable to filter out bumpy surfaces.
Peugeot 3008
What impresses me the most about the new 3008 is how much it has changed compared to its predecessor. The car's exterior design and road handling have both been improved, giving it a sportier feel, although it may not be as smooth as its predecessor. On the other hand, it falls behind its competitors in terms of interior space. Despite this, the 3008 still appeals to a wide range of drivers as it offers both internal combustion and EV options.
Renault Scenic
The Scenic E-tech is one of the most complete offerings in the electric SUV segment. It offers a convenient battery option, promises a good range, and provides ample space for all passengers. However, it doesn't really offer anything new that sets it apart from the Megane, which was launched two years ago. Moreover, I don't have any information about its price since it won't be launched in my country until 2025.
Toyota C-HR
The only car among the finalists that does not have an all-electric version, but that now has a plug-in version with sufficient electric range, making it the perfect choice for those seeking economic efficiency. Additionally, limited space for rear passengers has been shown not to affect buyers. Overall, it stands out among its competitors as the most practical option for everyday use.
Volvo EX30
Electric cars are no longer a futuristic dream, but I consider the Volvo EX30 a special vehicle. It stands out in every aspect, including its unique lack of switches in the interior, which gives it an edge over its competitors. Additionally, its overall quality is exceptional, making it a top contender in its class. The 2WD and 4WD models' performance is impressive, and the ride quality is excellent. On top of these, its price cannot be underestimated."
Hungary,Zsolt Csikós,6,5,1,3,4,5,1,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/zsolt-csikos.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
There is a version here for everyone: petrol, diesel, hybrid, PHEV and electric, RWD and AWD clad in sedan or station wagon bodies. The most car-like contender this year: there is real driving enjoyment to be had with the ICE variants; the BEV is a bit more blunt, but has good range. Ride comfort is incredible, levels of self-driving are at a new level, and compared to its rivals the price is right.
BYD Seal
The BYD Seal makes one understand why Chinese cars are gaining popularity. It brings real technological novelties: the cobalt-free blade LFP battery which is highly resistant to fire hazards and has a long life, the 8-in-1 compact power train. The Seal has proper performance, good road holding, a long range, a comfy interior, it is well-specced, affordably priced and quality is also high.
Kia EV9
The EV9 is vast, powerful, crammed with features, boldly styled and has a battery with the capacity to power a smaller city. You either get a real seven-seater configuration or may choose a six seater with four motorized lounge chairs. The car hides its 2.6 tons: it rides and drives well, although it is far from being a sports car. And for the heavy price we'd expect a higher quality finish inside.
Peugeot 3008
The new 3008 series probably has the most daring, coherent interior here. The line-up includes a mild hybrid ICE, a PHEV and a BEV version. The exterior design is outstanding, too, noise levels are low, ride comfort is high and there's a version with a 98 kWh battery. But the car isn't spacious in the second row, even the base model is overly heavy - you can feel this -, the price is also very high.
Renault Scenic
Here is the best package of qualities this year. An exceptionally roomy, comfortable car boasting a high-quality interior. Extremely low on weight, pleasant to drive, good to look at, giving agreeable verve from a right-sized motor, plus an acceptably long range given the size of the battery packs available. A car that uses the earth's resources wisely, one that is eminently usable and affordable, too.
Toyota C-HR
Toyota says 85% of customers still buy ICE-powered cars, and for them the C-HR is a really good choice. Especially the PHEV, which doesn't show the rubber-band CVT effect the hybrid versions do, although it also costs more than many pure BEV's. Quality and road holding have gone up, noise levels down, but the C-HR is still a dark prison cell for its rear occupants. And we don't see real innovation here.
Volvo EX30
Funky, lively on the road, the EX30 BEV has the best design, the strongest character of all cars this year. The interior is simple but tasty, well-built and practical. There is a hugely powerful and quick twin-motor version, but the real deal is the one with RWD and an LFP battery - it costs less than most PHEV-s. But range is below average, the boot is small and space is very tight in the second row."
,Miklos Gajdan,7,2,2,3,4,5,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/miklos-gajdan.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
The new BMW 5-series offers customers the widest range of choice. There are two body styles, sedan and station wagon, and a broad choice of powertrains - petrol, diesel, plug-in hybrid and now even two battery-electric. The 5-series offers first-class refinement and comfort, agile handling, an excellent infotainment system and modern assistants, including advanced self-driving capabilities.
BYD Seal
The BYD Seal offers its consumers exceptional value for money. For similar price than of an internal combustion engine car with comparable performance, the consumer gets a battery electric car with spacious, high-quality and very well-equipped interior, up to date infotainment system, two powerful powertrain choices, good range, agile handling, and a lot of assistance systems.
Kia EV9
The Kia EV9 is the largest and most luxurious model of the Korean brand. And yes, it is electric with good range and fast charging! Its large size is justified by the fact that its spacious, versatile, comfortable, luxuriously equipped and quiet passenger compartment can accommodate six or even seven people. Users will like its comfortable ride and very easy to use modern infotainment system.
Peugeot 3008
The attractive looking Peugeot E-3008 is the perfect electric car for family trips. Even over long distances, and not only because it has the option of a large battery, but also because its powertrain is economical. And also because its interior is strikingly stylish, high-quality, well equipped, comfortable and quiet, it has a nice and user friendly multimedia system, and rides well.
Renault Scenic
The new all-electric Renault Scenic is one of the best all-round electric cars. The interior, which is very spacious even in the second row, is attractive, well-made and well-equipped and the boot is huge. Due to its low consumption, it has a long range with the larger capacity battery. Its balanced suspension ensures a comfortable ride and agile handling. And it is offered at an affordable price.
Toyota C-HR
The new Toyota C-HR is one of the best choices for those who are not yet ready for the electric age, but are looking for an extremely economical and easy-to-operate car with outstanding looks, beautiful, well-finished and quiet interior, smooth ride and agile handling. Maybe the best choice for them from the four hybrid powertrains is the new PHEV version with relatively long electric range.
Volvo EX30
Volvo's brand new small electric SUV leaves its rivals standing in at least two respects. One is the shockingly low price of its entry-level model, and the other is its acceleration ability which even surpasses of many sports cars. It has brilliant ride and handling balance, attractive, well-finished and well-equipped interior with lots of storage space. And last but not least fun to drive it."
Ireland,Michael McAleer,4,6,2,1,3,8,1,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/michael-mcaleer.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
This is the eighth generation of BMW's business class saloon. It's a mainstay of the executive market and for decades formed the benchmark against which others were judged. Recently Mercedes-Benz has closed the gap, overtaking them in our opinion at the last test.
This new generation adds full electric to the mix, and looks likely to change the demographics of its fleet, once dominated by an impressive 2-litre turbodiesel that was the go-to choice for many European buyers.
Out goes diesel this time and instead you get a choice of mild petrol-electric hybrids, full hybrids, plug-in hybrids and all-electric versions in the form of the i5 iterations. Even the upcoming M5 will be a planet-saving plug-in hybrid, putting out 700bhp.
It's easy to get distracted by the tech in this car, but BMW's DNA has always been about the driving.
The first thing you notice about the new 5-series, if you don't get lost in the apps - is its size. This is a big car, measuring in at over 5 meters.
Taking that into account, the ride on the new 5 is sublime. It's a rather complex suspension set-up, but it delivers and this big car can corner - and at speed.
The magic in the i5 comes with the boost button, particularly in the M60 variant which takes the 340bhp regular rear-wheel driver version, then adds another electric motor to deliver four-wheel drive, doubles the torque and throws in an extra 261hp for good measure.
BMW has tried to cover every base with this car: it embraces the digital car ethos, awash with tech; it comes in all the eco-friendly formats; it retains most - if not all - of the driving pleasure of the past. It just comes with a very hefty price tag.
BYD Seal
This car has been the biggest surprise of the year so far. We were expecting just another solid but forgettable Chinese EV. Amid the crowd this car really stood out.
It's incredibly fast, sleekly styled and though the interior dances along the line between plush and bling it just about manages to stay on the right side of it.
Thanks to its 'Blade Battery' set-up, BYD - which is at heart a battery maker - has an edge on rivals in terms of its packaging and also its battery chemistry. Its cells have electrodes of lithium, iron and phosphate (LFP). The benefits of LFPs are that they are cheaper, more durable, less prone to overheating on rapid charging. They tend to have longer lifespans as well. BYD also show that they're no slouch when it comes to performance either. What's more, they don't use the rarer metals like cobalt or manganese.
The Seal is not without its flaws. We've driven several Seals and in a few cases we found the steering to vibrate more than on others.
Yet its overall ride quality is supple and cosseted, while it threads very neatly through the bends. The steering is well-calibrated for a sporty saloon and the braking manages to mix a good balance between its regenerative efforts and its anchoring needs. Like all the cars that lean on a central touchscreen to manage the controls, the plethora of menus can initially drive you demented, but we quickly found our way around after a few hours.
Overall, it's a surprisingly strong offering that looks smart, is fun to drive, delivers impressive range and is remarkably well-priced. That's enough boxes ticked to make it our top choice for 2024.
Kia EV9
It's a big all-electric seven-seater and that's a format many families have been waiting for, so Kia should be on to a winner with this car. Price is going to be an issue - this isn't cheap - but it delivers massive practicality and it's all cloaked in a smartly styled SUV with a powerful battery delivering useable range. Price is not the only hurdle, however. This car is big - and feels it around tight European roads and streets. It's stature also impacts on the ride and handling of the car, where it doesn't deliver the same nimble agility of its award-winning EV6 sibling, with which it shares its underpinnings.
Peugeot 3008
The original 3008 was a revolution. It turned around the fortunes of Peugeot and redefined it for consumers and critics. Awards duly followed. Lovely to drive, it had a game-changing cabin that was a match for many premium brands. All it lacked was the leap to electric.
Enter the new generation, to be offered in all flavors - from mild-hybrid to full electric. For the EV version, two battery sizes are on offer: 73kWh and 98kWh.
In trying to cover all bases and make room for the sort of battery packs that will deliver top-level range, invariably there is a price to be paid, and it's a heavy car. This shows up when you tackle a series of bends or a bumpy road.
The cabin is as beautiful as the first generation, and it is streets ahead of its rivals with their swathes of hard plastic. The long-legged range will suit those who don't have faith in the public charging infrastructure but still want to move to full electric. It's a refined offering, but doesn't deliver the driving spark that made the original 3008 a stellar success.
Renault Scenic
This is a very impressive EV and a handsome car that's good to drive and offers a smooth ride.
The original Scenic was an innovative gamechanger for young families. This car doesn't deliver any of that same magic. It begs the question: is this just a bigger Megane E-Tech, with better rear seat legroom and a bigger battery?
It has a fancy pair of brackets in the rear seat armrest that hold your phone or tablet, and the Solarbay glass roof that can be rendered opaque in sections by LCD switching. Renault also commissioned Jean-Michelle Jarre to compose the various beeps and bongs, such as the pedestrian warning noise. Those don't make up for the fact the second-row seats no longer slide.
The battery set-up delivers competitive range and while the ride can be firm, it's generally comfortable.
If you're looking for a spacious family EV crossover and in that regard this Scenic is a very good car. It's just that with this moniker, we were hoping for more.
Toyota C-HR
Toyota claims to make cars for everyone, for use everyday, and everywhere. This may be the exception to that rule. The C-HR is designed for Europe and predominantly for the driver. Matching the best the brand has to offer in terms of its hybrid technology, the smart styling of a compact crossover and a cabin that would do Lexus proud, the recipe is right. Yet the rear space is tight and the driver orientated central console suggests a degree of selfish indulgence that leaves all other occupants as an afterthought. It's a nice car to drive in all its variants and it handles well but it lacks the level of practicality buyers expect from this brand at this price.
Volvo EX30
It's the most affordable all-electric Volvo on the market. It's also the fastest Volvo ever made. It's not just fast - this rather formulaic compact family car can outrun most supercars.
For €52,995 you can get yourself a little boxy school-run SUV that can get from 0-100km/h in 3.6 seconds. Forget about hot hatches. Remember the famous Ferrari Enzo from 2002 and auctions these days for circa €3.3 million? Well, this Swedish crossover can match its pace.
When you are not leaving Ferraris standing at the lights, what you have is pretty much the standard fare Volvo package, from the chunky styling to the comfy seats. Only this time there's a lot less on the dash. Virtually every control is operated through two stalks, steering wheel buttons, or the 12.3-inch central tablet touchscreen. And because they opted for a sound bar running across the bottom of the windscreen - saving the need for speakers in the doors - there is no room for a heads-up display.
It's an odd move, particularly for Volvo, a brand that plays on its reputation for being obsessively safety conscious. Here you have the fastest car they've ever made and they've moved the speed display away from the driver's direct eyeline.
That said, there is no shortage of safety features and alerts, including useful warnings if you're about to open the door on to a passing bicycle or car.
Volvo has been an eager adherent to the sustainable production principle, understanding that the carbon footprint of the car begins during production and not just when you take it on the road.
However, the end result is a cabin that feels a little austere. It's functional, but the lack of switches - and a driver's screen - is a step too far.
My biggest qualm with this car is that nobody asked for a hot-hatch Volvo crossover. This compact crossover is meant for family buyers and that's why the single motor version is more than enough. Its potential buyers will be more focused on practicality than performance."
Italy,Silvia Baruffaldi,4,3,5,3,4,4,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/silvia-baruffaldi.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
With the beautifully designed 5-series, BMW confirms its ""Power of choice"" philosophy, leaving to the customer the freedom to select the type of powertrain that better suits his/her preferences without any sacrifice on the exterior and interior features. As an add on, customers could soon also choose a Touring wagon variant.
BYD Seal
I drove the Seal after a BYD Atto 3 and the improvements are remarkable, both on performance and battery range. The car is fun to drive, has excellent handling and lots of power, combined with the accurate design of the aerodynamic silhouette and the elegant interior. The infotainment system still needs to be calibrated to European standards, otherwise it's a noteworthy car.
Kia EV9
Kia proved once again its ability in producing excellent vehicles with good quality for price, even if in this case the 100-kW battery pack makes the price tag all but cheap. The EV9 is definitely oversized for European roads - where rear steering wheels would have helped - but it's one of the few 7-seater available here, offering a super comfortable interior. Last but not least, its design stands out from the crowd with a modern and original look.
Peugeot 3008
This model seems to bring together all the features favored by European customers: a crossover body, a sporty look and a choice of different powertrains on top of a pure EV version. Its interior is a design masterpiece, especially for the dashboard which combines exquisite style and ideal proportions for a good visibility of Peugeot's iconic i-Cockpit, now extended into a panoramic dimension.
Renault Scenic
With the Scenic, Renault crosses the 500-kilometre range milestone, marking an important step forward compared to the Megane E-Tech it is derived from, featuring a taller body and with an even roomier passenger compartment. Its R-Link infotainment system is by far one of the best in the market - not only among the seven finalists - intuitive to use and super-practical thanks to the Google auto operating system.
Toyota C-HR
With this second-generation C-HR, Toyota's creative team and engineers were capable of evolving a bold and original style into a more mature, but still perfectly recognizable, exterior design. The interior is fresh but not on par with the exterior boldness. Overall the car looks appealing, while it turns out to be a bit disappointing at the wheel, especially for the CVT gearbox.
Volvo EX30
Volvo's commitment to offer a small and efficient electric SUV is admirable and perfectly successful in terms of design, unmistakably Volvo while fresh and evolutionary. This minimalistic approach goes a bit too far eliminating any form or size of instrument cluster in front of the driver, while too many controls became solely touch and all hosted in the central display: definitely impractical, if not questionable in terms of driver's potential distractions."
,Andrea Brambilla,4,2,5,4,4,3,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/andrea-brambilla.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
The traditional lines and its growing dimension make this car a flagship product; however, they outshine the highly valuable technology that can be found in this vehicle.
BYD Seal
The intriguing design of this car poorly resembles its birthplace and it is much closer to European standards. However, the trunk is quite small despite the large dimensions of the car and there are still a few problems regarding the infotainments, that results a bit difficult to properly use.
Kia EV9
The EV9 confirms the growth in regard to technology and quality of the household.
While driving, the remarkable dimensions of the car are not detectable; however, it is clearly a product more suitable for a extra-European market.
Peugeot 3008
Its design, technology and the new substructure make this vehicle a true turning point in electric mobility. The battery autonomy and power train allow you to use this car almost as you would use an endothermic one.
Renault Scenic
The design and motorization confirm the path started with the Megan high-tech. The effort of the French household in regard to electrification is very clear and it is also confirmed by a high-tech infotainment that can also be found on other vehicles (also the endothermic ones) of the household.
Toyota C-HR
The great effort spent on the exterior design of this vehicle unfortunately doesn't match the interiors, creating almost a clash between interior and exterior spaces. The infotainment and the air-conditioning are not in line with the times.
Volvo EX30
The little Volvo is liked by many for its designs and its spacious insides (despite its contained dimensions). The choice of grouping all the functions in one single tablet at the center of the dashboard is clearly an effort into reducing costs; however, it can be distracting for the driver especially when checking the odometer. The extreme research for a green solution reflects poorly on the interior design."
,Mario Cianflone,4,4,5,3,4,4,1,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/mario-cianflone.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
A pretty execution of a premium mid-range car with efficient combustion, hybrid ed 100% electric powertrains. The style, although elegant, does not introduce eye-catching elements. Very high driving pleasure, abundant space on board. High price with expensive options make it a car for few people or for the car lists of top managers of company fleets.
BYD Seal
Electric sedan with a pleasant exterior design and a hit-tech baroque interior. Range and efficiency free from criticism. Offers healthy behavior and is pleasant to drive with wow performances. The rotating display is nice, but the user interface of the infotainment system needs to be completely revised. However, the layout of the physical buttons in the right number is appreciable.
Kia EV9
Huge SUV that sports a disruptive design. On board it offers the comfort of a lounge with excellent habitability. Range is more than good autonomy and acceptable consumption also in relation to the size and to the performance. Excellent assembly and materials. The price projects Ev9 in a premium sector where no Kia has gone before.
Peugeot 3008
Exterior and interior nicely styled with attention to detail in the layout, ergonomics and spaces distribution. Suspended Cockpit/infotainment is spectacular but the software could be better and the TomTom maps don't make sense. It marks a new course of the brand thanks to the new STLA Medium platform. The E-3008 is a valid alternative to the best EV SUVs, with ok comfort and drivability.
Renault Scenic
This model, with a pleasant style, has the advantage of offering plenty of space with range anxiety-proof battery. Nice to drive and comfortable. The digital system is the same as the other Renault models: it has the plus of Android Automotive Os services with Google maps but it deserves a model specific graphics. The three right levers on the column controls must be modified.
Toyota C-HR
The exteriors exhibit a pleasant and modern line, while the interiors are not convincing: too many buttons and the look of some details (the climate display) is obsolete. The space for the front passenger is also critical. The full hybrid and phev powertrains are efficient, but I do not like the feel and sound of the CVT transmission. Pleasantly honest road behavior.
Volvo EX30
A turning point for Volvo at a competitive Bev price. I appreciate the exterior style and the intrinsically sustainable minimalist philosophy (fewer wiring and buttons; soundbar instead of door mounted speakers) but the whole execution is too much radical: everything is controlled by an Android device with minimal automotive specific U.I that it lacks ergonomicsof. Consumption and efficiency not the best."
,Gian-Luca Pellegrini,5,3,2,6,2,3,4,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/gian-luca-pellegrini.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
With the 5-series you can't go wrong. It stands out for its meticulous technical precision, with a cabin that consistently ranks top-notch in terms of materials and craftsmanship, and its road manners are flawless. While there are minor cost-cuttings when compared to its predecessors, these do not detract from what remains an outstanding project. The diverse range of powertrains, including a sophisticated diesel option favored by those who cover long distances despite political scrutiny, is a notable feature. Recently, a station wagon model has expanded the lineup.
BYD Seal
The first Chinese product to arrive among the seven finalists of the COTY demonstrates the maturity reached by BYD's electric line-up. Well-built, it offers - in addition to excellent performance - dynamic qualities that do not suffer from an inferiority complex compared to cars from European and American brands with a more prestigious pedigree. More than adequate autonomy. The display, which can be oriented as desired, is a nice gadget to have but has little impact on life onboard. Difficult to find weaknesses in this car.
Kia EV9
This vehicle stands out as a true giant among its competitors. Stretching five meters, it offers an extraordinary level of comfort that is rare on European roads. Its size and price reflect the high-end aspirations of this electric vehicle (EV) series. For those undaunted by its dimensions and cost, the car boasts impressive technical specifications and outstanding performance, especially when considering its considerable weight. Its substantial battery capacity ensures a commendable range, complemented by rapid charging capabilities courtesy of the 800-volt system characteristic of the Korean manufacturer. This vehicle may not cater to all tastes, but I commend it for introducing an innovative approach to the idea of a luxury flagship vehicle.
Peugeot 3008
Following the Stellantis group's customary approach, the line-up begins with a fully electric version before introducing a mild-hybrid petrol variant. The handling meets the high standards associated with the Peugeot name, yet the most striking feature is the interior. The design of the dashboard and instrument panel is truly innovative and modern, setting it apart in the market.
Renault Scenic
Leveraging the well known Megane platform, this model maintains the qualities of its sibling while incorporating an enhanced battery option. The vehicle's performance on the road is consistently reliable, with its driving dynamics, range, and infotainment system ranking among the best in its class. Renault reinforces its position as a creator of good and accessible battery electric vehicles.
Toyota C-HR
The sequel to a highly popular car in Europe, this second series follows closely in the footsteps of its forerunner, preserving the model's core philosophy while enhancing the features that have contributed to its acclaim. True to Toyota's ethos, it comes as a full hybrid, offering remarkable efficiency, and now also boasts a compelling plug-in variant with commendable range. Its handling at high speeds reveals a level of agility that might surprise some for a vehicle in this category. A robust offering that continues to merit its sustained popularity.
Volvo EX30
This model is undoubtedly intriguing, aiming to broaden the accessibility of a premium brand's Bev offerings. Despite appearing larger in photographs, it provides a pleasing driving experience and nimble acceleration. However, its real-world range at cruising speeds leaves something to be desired. The spartan interior, which strips away any ornamental elements, may not capture the hearts of all users, especially with the decision to consolidate most functions into the central touchscreen interface."
,Alberto Sabbatini,7,3,5,2,3,3,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/alberto-sabbatini.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
It is the car with the most complete offer: diesel hybrid, pure electric, sedan and wagon too. It's over 5 meters long but very easy to handle thanks to the excellent frame and the steering rear wheels which make parking easy. But it is also the most expensive one because the customer pays for the luxury and the brand. The high price makes it too exclusive.
BYD Seal
The first Chinese car among the COTY finalists is indeed a real surprise. It's not a low-cost Chinese car but it's as well built as a European car. Nice design, excellent powertrain, high performance, good efficiency. The infotainment is surprising and boasts details never seen on any other car. Unfortunately, the sedan body style is no longer preferred in many European countries.
Kia EV9
A very large SUV with an aggressive and very innovative design which however may not be attractive to everyone. The powertrain is not in question but size and weight limit autonomy a bit. It would be the ideal car as a limousine to be transported in the very comfortable and versatile rear seats like the business class seats of an airplane.
Peugeot 3008
It is the newest car overall among the seven finalists. New platform, new powertrain, revolutionary interior and driver's seat design. The i-cockpit and floating curved display are a great touch. Inside the car is comfortable and spacious but it has become 10 cm longer comparing to the old model, perhaps too big for global use.
Renault Scenic
It's my favorite because it's the best compromise in every aspect. It has all the advantages that made the first Scenic successful - space on board, versatility, comfort, affordable price - reinvented in a modern key with electric traction. Above all, it is the only electric car among the finalists that allows you to get close to 500 km of travel in real use and forget about charging anxiety.
Toyota C-HR
Toyota remains faithful to its hybrid choice by offering the plug-in or full hybrid on the C-HR. It's a solid car, with a very efficient powertrain but doesn't feel like a big step up from the old model. It's not so roomy inside, the infotainment is not very satisfying and the car still has the annoying scooter effect caused by the CVT gearbox so my rating is not among the highest.
Volvo EX30
The new Volvo is a provocative car and has an excellent price. I like the philosophy of the project: it has the right dimensions to be a car suitable for both city use and travel. But in my opinion the designers dared too much. It has many small defects: it can only be managed via the tablet and it lacks a dashboard; so every time you look at the speed on the screen you are distracted from the road."
,Giorgio Ursicino,5,3,4,4,3,3,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/giorgio-ursicino.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Iconic and global car for the Monaco company which is offered in a very wide range. Based on a multi-energy platform, it is available with electric, petrol and diesel engines, both in sedan and wagon versions and in the M sports configuration. The 100% battery variant is very efficient, capable of annoying rivals from brands that only produce zero emission vehicles.
BYD Seal
The first car from a Chinese brand among the seven finalists of the award, a model that will pave the way for the eastern country's strategies in Europe. The Seal is an excellent example to demonstrate the level of technology of new players in the automotive sector but very well prepared when it comes to electric mobility. All aspects of driving dynamics on which experience should make a difference are also of a notable level.
Kia EV9
The Korean company often enters the finalists and the EV9 also hit the mark. The vehicle is a generously sized SUV (over 5 meters long with a wheelbase exceeding 3) which anticipates a series of sport utility vehicles already shown by Kia. It is based on the now famous E-GMP native electric platform which has already established its qualities and also performs excellently in this configuration.
Peugeot 3008
The new 3008 arrives and the first of the four STLA architectures on which Stellantis will soon work for the energy transition makes its debut. Large battery, excellent autonomy which in the WLTP cycle goes up to 700 km. The somewhat fastback style design is very pleasant, in the passenger compartment the dashboard which houses the Panoramic i-Cockpit stands out, the latest evolution of an originality from the house of Leone.
Renault Scenic
In a year in which the ranking is very short and the models are quite close in value, for me the Scenic is the Car of the Year 2024. The result of the new organization of the Renault group which saw the birth of Ampere, Renault's historic model breaks with the past and offers an offer that is excellently balanced between performance and costs. The 87 kWh battery guarantees an autonomy of 625 km in the WLTP cycle. Two engines of 125 and 160 kW.
Toyota C-HR
The only model among the finalists that does not have a zero emission version. Toyota is still focusing heavily on its flagship, full hybrid technology which is certainly optimal for those markets not yet ripe for electric motorization. For having the combustion engine, the efficiency achieved is remarkable, the driving fluid and relaxing. The line is always original, with a much appreciated sporty look.
Volvo EX30
Volvo's most compact car is an electric one made on the platform shared with the eastern parent company. Agile and safe, the basic version already features an almost 300 horsepower engine, while the twin-engine has a true sports car temperament and searing acceleration. The interior is minimalist but elegant, the price is very accessible with a high value."
Luxembourg,Alain Rousseau,7,2,5,4,1,5,1,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/alain-rousseau.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Aimed at heavy-duty drivers, the new 5-series offers an intelligent mix of powertrains, from full electric to hybrid and diesel. The latter offers a range of over 1,000 kilometers. It's a pity that the quality of the materials and the ergonomics of the dashboard have fallen behind previous models. The touring version is the first premium electric estate car.
BYD Seal
The Seal is the first Chinese car to reach the final of the COTY trophy. This is no coincidence: elegant and well-designed, it surprises with its performance (530 bhp in the top-of-the-range version) and its top-level roadholding. The standard equipment is plentiful. The only minor faults are that the front seats are a little short and the control screen is not always easy to operate.
Kia EV9
Kia likes to surprise, and so much the better! Its new 100% electric flagship is a real invitation to travel, offering unrivalled comfort and modularity. Despite its imposing dimensions and weight, its roadholding is safe and impressively efficient. The EV 9 can also tow up to 2.5 tons, which will appeal to caravan and boat owners.
Peugeot 3008
Regardless of its engine (PHEV or BEV), the new 3008 is an excellent tourer that also pleases with its very successful 'fastback' look. The front seats are perfect and the ride comfort is excellent (agility, damping). The i-cockpit that is so dear to the French brand has been redesigned. However, it continues to divide opinion because it creates an unusual driving position.
Renault Scenic
The Scenic compact wagon has abandoned the MPV concept and its combustion engines to become a 100% electric crossover/SUV. Rear passenger and luggage space is remarkable for a vehicle of this size. The powertrains are both powerful and efficient (with a real range of 450 km in mixed conditions), and the vehicle handles well and safely.
Toyota C-HR
The Toyota C-HR relies heavily on its looks to win over customers. Compared to the model it replaces, it also offers a wider range of - sometimes intrusive - driving aids. On the mechanical side, there's the inevitable CVT gearbox, which still causes the engine to 'race' under hard acceleration. The car's fuel economy and overall comfort are good points.
Volvo EX30
This little Sino-Swedish car aims to be disruptive, at the risk of overdoing it. Even if it is pleasant to look at and to drive, it suffers from a major ergonomic flaw: almost all the car's functions are controlled via a large central screen, which means that you constantly have to take your eyes off the road - even to check the speed!"
Netherlands,Jaco Bijlsma,8,4,3,1,5,4,0,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/jaco-bijlsma.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
The German car builder pays tribute to the M in its name with a variety of motors in the 5-series. It reflects the real market situation where still is demand for ICE-drivelines. BMW proves that they are also capable of producing a fully electric car that is a real BMW: the i5 communicates that its made for real driving. Chassis set-up and steering are still at a level that makes driving fun. But still a premium brand with a premium price.
BYD Seal
Car that looks and drives dynamical. Impressive build-quality also. But biggest strong point is value for money because its standard equipment-level is high. Blade battery technique is innovative constructionwise, offering benefits in terms of safety and usage of raw materials. Lacks status and brand identity in Europe: its no rebel brand like Tesla and needs time to achieve a premium status.
Kia EV9
It looks as intimidating as a futuristic Hummer, its very functional with a practical interior for seven but is also too big for the city and heavy. The electrical architecture is generous in most ways but not innovative because the former Car of the Year EV6 already introduced most of it. If your driveway is big enough and you like driving long distances in maximum comfort the EV9 is a great travelmate as long as you realize its an EV that punishes you for too high cruising speeds with a rapid decreasing range.
Peugeot 3008
Its claimed maximum range of 700 km is in this class groundbreaking but that version is not on the market and tested yet. Designwise a special cross-over with modern looks that radiate luxury, speed and dynamism. Even in terms of functionality the E-3008 does not disappoint and offers sufficient room and practicality. But it is less spacious in the back than the Renault Scenic. If it lives up to its promises regarding range and charging-speed, it could be an attractive offer. Especially because it offers a wide range of drivelines.
Renault Scenic
No MPV anymore but a cross-over which almost offers versatility on the same level. The interior offers a lot of space and some clever practical solutions. The electric drivelines offer charging speeds and capacity that range from sufficient to a royal range of 625 km. Not as cheap as initially announced but still good value for money. Good infotainment with user-friendly Google-system. Cockpit is well balanced and driver orientated with enough physical buttons also. Good all-round car that drives comfortable, weight watching resulted in a car that's lighter than many competitors.
Toyota C-HR
Car which offers the best hybrid-technology available in terms of fuel-economy and durability. A practical choice for all those people who are not ready for the full electrical car yet. In terms of design and technique no news because its predecessor was a good hybrid also and it pioneered its coupé high rider body style already.
Volvo EX30
Appealing to many because of its sharp entry level price and trusted brand name that we know for its safety-pioneering and durability. A quality car for an affordable price in a popular segment where BEV's are still quite sparse made it a wannahave before it entered the market. Price, range, charging speed and equipment are good. Handles well and drives comfortable. The lack of interior space and seating comfort in the back are flaws The choice for a central display is quite common these days but a Volvo should offer a better set-up or a head-up-display so that you can keep your eyes on the road. The central placing of the window-buttons are also more motivated by cost-efficiency than by the laws of ergonomics."
,Frank Buma,8,1,3,4,6,2,1,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/frank-buma.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
For the eighth time in a row, BMW succeeded in making its 5-series better than before. It even has a fully electric counterpart this time. A first for the 5-series, but not for the car world in general. The same goes for its equipment and safety features. Therefore, it doesn't stand out between its many competitors, although the BMW is still one of the best driving cars within its segment.
BYD Seal
In less than two years BYD succeeded in putting six different models in their showroom and securing a nomination for the Car of the Year. The Seal impresses with a powerful engine and a high build quality. The BYD is not as efficient as its competitors and the same goes for its chassis and ergonomics. Nevertheless: we're bound to see a lot more of the manufacturer in the years to come!
Kia EV9
Don't be fooled by the toylike appearance of the EV9: Kia offers a technical highlight with this electric seven-seater. It's one of the first EV's that you can use as a home battery. And rightly so, because consumers will want to earn some money back on the steep purchase price. Although the Kia offers all the room a large family will need, maneuvering the big friendly giant can be a pain.
Peugeot 3008
Peugeot sets high standards with its new 3008. If features a distinctive cockpit design, 8 years of warranty - a first for an European car brand - and an electric version with 700 kilometers of range. That big battery will cost you though. In addition, its fastback exterior has made the Peugeot less practical than before. It doesn't matter if you buy an E-3008 or a petrol one.
Renault Scenic
Once a petrol MPV, the Renault Scenic is now a fully electric crossover. The French managed to keep the dimensions modest, while there's more boot space than before. It also features a clever armrest for the rear passengers. Thanks to Google the Scenic picks its own charging stops during longer journeys. Not that you need to charge much: it offers almost 90 kWh of battery, for less than € 50.000!
Toyota C-HR
The Toyota C-HR was a radical car once. Now you see one every day. Its design has always covered up the fact that the C-HR isn't that practical or spacious. This second generation isn't either, although it is still a nice, economical car to drive thanks to the addition of a plug-in hybrid powertrain. Within its hybrid line-up Toyota offers better value for money than the C-HR though.
Volvo EX30
A big shout out to Volvo, which - as a premium brand - has committed to make EV's more affordable to the general public. But for an attractive entry price, Volvo had to cut some corners. The EX30 is not as efficient as its competitors, neither is it spacious or logical to operate. Preferring a sound bar over a head up display is unworthy of a brand that has made safety its trademark."

BMW 5-series
Available with a wide range of powertrains, allowing it to perform well in every market. Refined electric i5 with good real-world range. Comfortable interior with high build quality. The controls require some practice. Enjoyable steering, showcasing some authentic BMW DNA. The chassis is initially tuned for comfort, but with the right options, it becomes a convincing sports sedan.
BYD Seal
Great value for money. Large battery and significant real-world range. Spacious interior and nice materials. Charging performance is less impressive and no battery preconditioning. Comfortable steering and driving. The 4WD drives better than the RWD. The RWD is underdamped, resulting in unnecessary body movements. It feels restless at higher cornering speeds. A good newcomer in its class.
Kia EV9
Large car and a bold design statement. Lacks smart chassis technologies like air suspension, active roll stabilization, or four-wheel steering. These could add value given its class, size, and weight. Nonetheless, it offers a smooth ride and well-balanced steering. Very spacious and comfortable interior, for up to seven people. Excellent 800-volt technology with fast charging and a usable range.
Peugeot 3008
Offers a wide range of engines. All-round driving experience. Nicely made interior with comfortable seats. Despite its larger exterior dimensions, less spacious than the Renault Scenic. Limited headroom in the back. Above-average weight for its size. Multimedia system lays behind the competition. No preconditioning for the battery until winter 2025. Average charging performance.
Renault Scenic
Comfortable with smooth damping yet sufficiently controlled handling. Good multimedia system due to Google integration. Competitive prices. Good packaging allows for a generous trunk combined with big interior space. Comfortable seating position both in the front and in the rear. The charging performance is average. Preconditioning battery is standard. Relatively light.
Toyota C-HR
The only finalist not available as a BEV. Excellent hybrid technology, high reliability, ease of operation thanks to physical buttons, and a sleek appearance. Rather claustrophobic feeling in the back. Comfortable driving behavior and very economical. Multimedia no more than average. But too much of an evolution from the first generation C-HR to win the title.
Volvo EX30
Offers a refined blend of comfort and dynamism. Excellent damping. Responsive steering making the car feel agile and easy to maneuver. Good charging performance and a usable range, pre-conditioning battery is standard. Competitive prices. It has a mediocre user experience. All functions integrated into central screen, also the speedometer. No head-up display available. Rear legroom is very tight."

BMW 5-series
The new 5-series is offered with the power of choice, optional 2wd or 4wd, and as a sedan or a touring. The car is a true BMW, in both the definition and performance. Even the BEV version, i5, delivers as expected from a BMW. As a large premium car, it also comes with a high price, but it is still reasonable. A great competitor in this year's challenge, but the competition is hard this year.
BYD Seal
BYD Seal is a good contribution, and the first car from China to get to the final. It will certainly not be the last, and with the competition this year, it doesn'bring enough new to the market to really get up there to the top.
Kia EV9
EV9 is a true Kia, and together with all we know from its sibling EV6, is also has great space for up to seven people. The big cabin offers great flexibility. Even if it's a large car, it is packed with the comfort and functions as expected from a more premium and more road biased car. A great contender for the more active families, even without bringing a lot of new elements to the market.
Peugeot 3008
The 3008 points to the biggest group of buyers, together with optional 2wd or 4wd, and two battery sizes. The design inside and outside is to be mentioned especially, together with its practicality. It also brings new thinking to market, which will keep this car alive for years. A new 8-year warranty program will also bring extra security for the buyers. A true fighter to be The Car of the Year.
Renault Scenic
With its compact format, the new Scenic offers a lot of space all over. Two choices of battery, but only as a 2wd. Great functionality from the Android Auto OS operation system, and great handling and comfort. A really good choice, that is boosted with favorable pricing. The car is efficient and comes with a great range when chosen with the bigger battery. A true competitor, this year.
Toyota C-HR
The C-HR is a great car for now but does not bring in elements for the future. Also, its presence is a bit old fashion, more made from yesterday than today. It will sell a lot of cars, though, based on the need of a car like this in a lot of markets. In a market that are focused on true zero emissions, a car without a fully electric drivetrain is not an option, like in Norway.
Volvo EX30
The EX30 brings a new standard to smaller cars. It also comes with options of 2wd or 4wd. Also with two optional battery sizes, it fits a wide range of buyers. It also comes with great handling, comfort, performance, equipment, and high level of perceived quality feeling. When it also comes with a reasonable price tag, it will attract a wide range of customers, and is therefore on top of my list."
Poland,Roman Popkiewicz,5,5,2,8,2,0,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/roman-popkiewicz.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Despite being heavily promoted in electric versions, the new 5-series is more convincing with combustion engines. Handling is involving and precise, the only downside is that the car cannot disguise its big size and significant weight as well as previous generations of the 5-series did. The real star of the range is 550e, which preserves traditional six-cylinder inline engine and is one of the best plug-in hybrids on the market.
BYD Seal
There are a lot of good things about the Seal: good exterior design, good equipment, good handling, good range and good value. There are things that need improvement too, notably multimedia interface. However, apart from offering a lot of power and very quick acceleration the Seal does not distinguish itself in any special way among growing number of electric cars.
Kia EV9
A car that makes heads turn - and for very good reasons. The exterior design has a concept car quality to it, and on the road the EV9 is comfortable and smooth, offering large MPV levels of practicality. Very rapid charging makes it a good long-distance car too, even if range at highway speeds is not exceptional. A bold entry into new territory for Kia and a model that could elevate the brand to a new level.
Peugeot 3008
The big appeal of the new 3008 is sharp exterior design coupled with excellent interior - dashboard layout is the best of any modern Peugeot model so far and finish quality is on premium level. However, the car is very heavy, which compromises ride comfort and handling. And even in the entry 1.2 petrol mild hybrid form the price of new 3008 is quite high.
Renault Scenic
The new car is very different from the original Scenic, but in compact body dimensions still offers a spacious cabin. Easy driving nature of the Scenic E-Tech, with good handling balance, smooth ride and well weighted controls is very convincing - along with attractive interior and high-quality finish they make the Renault model one of the best electric vehicles of its size.
Toyota C-HR
There is no doubt that the popularity of the new C-HR will follow that of the first generation model. The new car is better in every respect: comfort is improved, interior quality is higher, multimedia system is much more advanced and the exterior styling is even more striking. But perhaps the interior space in the rear is compromised a bit too much - just like in the previous C-HR.
Volvo EX30
Exterior design of the EX30 is fantastic and the car will look just as fresh and attractive in few years' time as it does today. Handling characteristics are very good and there is a lot of power available - it all makes for involving driving. However, in order to have a dashboard free of traditional controls Volvo sacrifices a lot of functionality, as a result the driver is too often distracted while operating basic things."
,Maciek Ziemek,4,5,3,7,1,1,4,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/maciek-ziemek.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
The 5-series brought to perfection, which even BMW will find difficult to surpass in the future. A car that uses all the achievements of the automotive industry to date -excellent combustion engines, a plug-in hybrid drive system and an electric drive, as well as an interior made of 100% vegan materials, which are in no way inferior to the quality of materials used so far.
BYD Seal
It shows what Chinese manufacturers are already capable of but does not bring much new to the European automotive industry. A very good car in many respects, the most impressive thing is the almost 90% efficiency of the electric drive system and the quality of the interior. A comfortable driving position has its limitations if there are a full set of passengers in the car.
Kia EV9
Of all the models, it meets the criteria that should be met by the car of the year most fully. The bold and consistent design makes EV9 stand out on the road and be visible from a distance. The use of the interior, its functionality and ergonomics are almost exemplary. Ride and build quality too. Overall, the Kia EV9 takes electromobility to a new level of versatility.
Peugeot 3008
It will quickly become an example to follow when it comes to aesthetics and the quality of interior finishing. The pleasant-to-touch fabric that covers the decor on the dashboard and the curved screen that looks as if suspended in the air make the Peugeot 3008 cabin feel like a home living room. It's a pity that the 3008 has become less and less affordable.
Renault Scenic
A spacious and functional interior, good build quality, a great multimedia system and good driving characteristics make Renault Scenic once again a chance to become a travel companion for many families who need a car - above all - a practical one. Time will tell whether the exclusively electric drive system will not result in limited popularity of this model.
Toyota C-HR
The cheapest model among the finalists, which does not mean that it is cheap. As many as 4 versions of the hybrid drive system to choose from impress with their efficiency. It's a pity it's only in the city. On the highway, fuel consumption is no longer so low, and the car's range becomes small because the fuel tank has a too small capacity.
Volvo EX30
It is impressive with the use of recycled materials in the construction, but only a few users will be aware of. However, they will be irritated every day by ill-considered operation via touch screen, which absorbs too much attention. Instead of admonishing the driver with the message ""Focus on driving. Stay alert and avoid distractions., it would be nicer to make the experience user-friendly."
Portugal,Francisco Mota,4,3,4,2,2,4,6,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/francisco-mota.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
New generation 5-series is an evolution of the previous one, with a new electric version added. There are hybrid and mild hybrid versions available, even a Diesel. Each one is very competent in hitting its own target. Dynamics, styling and perceived quality are typical high points in the brand that made a serious effort to increase comfort. However, due to SUV rising sales, this class of cars is no longer as relevant as it was in the past.
BYD Seal
First Chinese car ever to get this far in this prize comes from a company that started as a rechargeable battery supplier. The Seal fits in the latest iteration of electric cars from this brand, with some unique features like the blade battery and cell-to-body concepts. Styling hits European tastes and dynamics are well sorted. Cabin suffers from ergonomic issues and energy efficiency is not the best in class.
Kia EV9
There's no lack of ambition from Kia when launching this new full-scale SUV. The company is aiming at premium brands with this full electric model. No shortage of room inside the cabin, however, perceived quality could be a little higher. Seven seats are available, all usable by adults. Dynamics are what can be expected from a big and heavy car, the same can be said about performance and energy efficiency.
Peugeot 3008
New generation 3008 changes everything and gets electric versions with relatively big batteries. Styling is an evolution of the previous model and cabin takes a step forward in the right direction. Mild Hybrid version is a good execution of a slightly different approach to the theme. Dynamics were tuned down in terms of agility, giving more emphasis to comfort. The electric versions are not light.
Renault Scenic
Scenic looks like a concept-car from the outside, giving a fresh look to this electric C-SUV within the company's portfolio. Cabin has lots of room, for the segment, however, lacks a little more perceived quality. Driving dynamics are precise and performance is adequate for a family car. There are a few ergonomic issues that could be improved; however, the infotainment system is one of the best.
Toyota C-HR
Second generation C-HR gets an updated styling and a renewed platform. Full hybrid system is one of the best in the market, both in terms of fuel efficiency and usability, especially in urban driving. Coupé-style body does not affect roominess. Cabin feels better designed and built than before. Driving dynamics can be both comfortable in everyday driving and enjoyable enough in country roads.
Volvo EX30
The small EX30 feels exactly that: small, making for a not very roomy rear seat. Cabin's minimalistic concept has taken a step too far, with too many functions accessible only through the infotainment system. And not all are easy to find. Suspension calibration gives full priority to comfort and not enough to road holding. Maximum available power is too high for a B-SUV, even for a premium one like this."
,Joaquim Oliveira,4,6,5,2,0,5,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/joaquim-oliveira.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Very broad engine portfolio, from diesel to petrol, from electric to plug-in hybrid, it will suit an ample spectre of customers with different needs, even if its price is not accessible to a majority of consumers. A reference in handling among electric cars (and also ICE), it features an advanced infotainment system. Generous 2nd row shoulder room and legroom but the floor tunnel is very intrusive.
BYD Seal
The impressive perceived quality and roomy cabin will win over many customers for the best Chinese car on sale in most European markets up until now. The electric propulsion system is convincing proving once again Chinese car brands have the needed know-how in e-propulsion. Steering, braking, drive modes and infotainment clearly have room for improvement. Killer price tag for what it offers.
Kia EV9
The 5-metre 2.7 tons boxy electric SUV costing over 60 000 euro is excessive for several markets, like Portugal. It offers a huge interior/trunk, but the absence of a rear steered axle can make drivers feel as uncomfortable during urban driving/parking as an elephant in a China store. The advanced e-propulsion has already been distinguished in the election of the EV6 as COTY two years ago.
Peugeot 3008
The appealing looks of the 3008 will win over many consumers but most will have to accept the hybrid powertrain is the one fitting their budget as the richly-specced EV inflates the E-3008 price beyond what would be desirable (even if the 700 km range will conquer healthier wallets). Steering, braking and handling are less sharp than most recent Peugeot cars, especially in the case of the electric version.
Renault Scenic
The MPV morphed into a EV-only Xover shape to please the audience but the exterior design is polarizing and when you are inside it's hard to differentiate it from a Megane EV, also in the way less convincing panel surfaces are used. More positive is the use of a sharp and fast google based OS as well as the generous 2nd room legroom and huge trunk, whereas shoulder room is much more limited. Poor steering/braking feel.
Toyota C-HR
The sportier looking matches the sportier competent handling. The compact SUV improves the (modernized) interior perceived quality and lets the digital instruments focus more on the driver. The hybrid-only powertrain line-up includes a plug-in option with a somewhat shy e-range. You can barely feel the difference between drive modes, the trunk is small and rear passengers' visibility is unsatisfying.
Volvo EX30
One of the good things about Geely's Volvo ownership was that the brand's DNA has been kept throughout the years... at least up until now. The EX30 fails in aspects like safety (the driver must remove his eyes from the road to check the speed he is driving at) and interior space (2nd row is very tight), while power is excessive for the vehicle's size and segment. Interior quality is also deceiving."
Slovenia,Sebastjan Plevnjak,3,6,3,2,9,0,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/sebastjan-plevnjak.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
BMW 5-series is pretty much the very best car among all the finalists. A car which is a result of more than 50 years in production. Plus, the only one among the finalists with multiple choices of electricity, petrol and diesel as propulsion exist. On top of overall high quality of manufacturing, it impressed with comfortable and smooth driving experience - an attribute not often to be found with BMW cars. All the premium virtues make the BMW 5-series almost the most expensive and, as such, not for everyone.
BYD Seal
It has become, more or less, clear to everyone by now that China produces good cars. Not only with quality, but also being able to please European taste in terms of external design and likeable interior. And that is exactly what the BYD Seal is - pleasantly shaped and even more pleasing inside the cabin, where both the driver and passenger can feel really good. Sadly, this car is not being sold in all European markets which, in my view, deprives it from being a completely rightful contender in the European COTY contest.
Kia EV9
Big, electric and - different! Excellent successor to our past winner EV6, bringing even more comfort and space. The ability to accommodate 7 people in 3 rows and, consequently, it's size, also means that it exceeds both the length and width of parking spaces most of the time. If, however, one lives in the countryside, EV9 could be a true perfect choice, unlike within difficult city traffic and congestion.
Peugeot 3008
Without a doubt, French do know how to make a car that can win the European COTY competition. The new 3008 is another full turnaround, just as the 2nd generation has been in 2017 to win the contest. This time all hopes are based on the EV variant. In essence, it is a good car, failing to be perfect mainly due to a truly high overall weight which, unavoidably, means a proportionally higher battery power consumption. Hybrid variants are coming, and I see that already as a positive.
Renault Scenic
Resurrection of names from the past is easily a double-edge sword. Some have the original in good memory, others less so. The former cannot choose the new model as a successor to the one they were so fond of as the contemporary Scenic has nothing in common except the name. It is, indeed, a totally new car, just as spacious and good looking, but far too expensive for an average consumer. Reason? It is driven merely by an electric motor.
Toyota C-HR
This is a car which moved Toyota outside the zone of traditional design. Personally, I still prefer looking at a saloon than a crossover. And, in that respect, I would give my vote rather to Prius, which has evolved into a truly top product. Because C-HR has a similar drivetrain, the C-HR is also excellent in the same sense and, therefore, a deserved finalist.
Volvo EX30
Small, electric and - something else! EX30 is. for me, this year's Bull's Eye! A complete automotive product which, even more so than with its outside image, impresses with a very nice interior. Special praise goes to ecological achievements, more thanks to high percentage use of recycled materials than for the electric drivetrain itself. At the same time, I was impressed how it drove offering the best of both worlds - comfortable cruising or a genuine sporty and dynamic pace. My only complaint is the omission of a separate speedometer. Finally, pricing of the EX30 is really very good."
Spain,Félix Cerezo,6,4,4,1,3,3,4,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/felix-cerezo.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
BMW has never won the Car of the Year in Europe. And the new Series 5 has almost everything needed to do so this year. The customer can choose between petrol or diesel engines with hybridization, PHEV and 100% electric engines; sedan or estate body; and rear or all-wheel drive. It is also an authentic BMW in terms of dynamics and quality. But due to its high price, size and options (too many and expensive), it's not my favourite.
BYD Seal
Everyone is talking about the big step forward for Chinese cars. The fact that the BYD Seal is on the short list shows it. Best of all, both versions are very good value for money. The 530 hp version with four-wheel drive and electronic suspension costs only 2,000 euros more in Spain (48,990 euros), but it can be a little abrupt in its reactions. What I don't like: the operation of some ADAs, the air conditioning, the information of the electrical system, which could be improved. The boot is small. Perhaps the next BYD Seal...
Kia EV9
It's a fantastic example of engineering and design. Sure, the best Kia ever. It's huge in every way: size, 385 HP, technology, quality, batteries (100 kWh), charging speed (240 kW)... In Spain it costs over 85,000 euros. The price and the size make it too far away from the general public. Moreover, some of its strengths, such as the 800-volt technology or the digitalization of the dashboard, were already taken into account when the EV6 won the COTY.
Peugeot 3008
It is the first Stellantis model to use the STLA Medium platform. What does this mean? A range with MHEV or PHEV versions and, as the star, the BEV with up 700 km (98 kW battery). Very attractive on the outside, inside I always liked the i-cockpit. The new 21"" evolution is better. Good handling, as usual in Peugeot. Weak points: high weight and smaller cabin or boot than the Renault E-Scenic, for example. It is not cheap.
Renault Scenic
Renault did a good job with the Megane E-Tech. The new Scenic E-Tech, an interesting family car, surpasses it. For example, in terms of price (from 38,000 euros) or battery (better recharging and up to 625 km of autonomy). The interior is a masterclass. The Open-R link system with native Google applications is one of the best on the market; all passengers have plenty of space (especially in the second row) and there is a good boot. Very light and fun to drive. Even if it consumes more than expected, it's my favourite.
Toyota C-HR
This is a car made in Europe for Europeans. And it is also the cheapest of the seven finalists (from 31.750 euros). Modern design exterior with large digital screens inside, but the atmosphere seems very serious to me. I like the 200 HP version, which can be all-wheel drive. And the new PHEV with 66 km zero emissions, i like much more. Although some aspect of its operation must be improved. And the trunk is small. The C-HR's consumption is very good in the city, not so much on the highway, where the 140 HP version is a bit annoying.
Volvo EX30
Small (4.23 meters long), 100% electric and the most sustainable car in the brand. These define the Volvo EX30. The price of the basic version, with 272 hp and a WLTP range of 344 km, is also a highlight: 36,770 euros in Spain (excluding government incentives). Quite a good price and not easy to find for a premium car. All the important information is displayed on the central screen and there are hardly any physical buttons. I would change this. The rear and boot are small. However, the power or the consumption can be excessive. I would have liked to test it further."
,Rafael Guitart,6,5,4,3,1,3,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/rafael-guitart.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Great offer of BMW in the 5-series, with gasoline, diesel, plug-in hybrid and electric engines, powered from 200 to 600 hp, sedan and estate car bodies, as well as all-wheel drive. Good handling, high quality finish and complete equipment in a standard model of large dimensions. Only the central tunnel subtracts some habitability in the rear seats.
BYD Seal
Surprising staging of BYD's mid-size sedan, with high-performance variants, great standard equipment, very sporty behavior and high-capacity battery. Particularly noteworthy is the AWD version with 530 hp. Room for improvement on the throttle response, the climate control system and multimedia equipment, with unclear information and some difficulty in management.
Kia EV9
KIA's experience in the electric field is clearly visible in this model, which shares some features seen in the EV6. Its enormous proportions stand out, somewhat complex for the European market and that conditions the efficiency when traveling on the highway. Innovative and efficient in terms of charging, such as the 800-volt technology or the V2L and V2G bidirectional charging system, with the possibility of supplying energy to a home.
Peugeot 3008
Change of look for the Peugeot 3008, which is moving towards a modern fastback concept. Hybrid, plug-in hybrid or pure electric mechanical options. In its favor, future versions stand out as they are equipped with all-wheel drive and large range, with a promise of up to 700 km WLTP. Good behavior and comfort, although the space in the rear seats is a bit scarce and the position of the driving mode selector is far from the driver's hand.
Renault Scenic
New strategy in the model, which is only offered in electric versions of 170 and 220 hp, with two battery sizes, 60 or 87 kWh capacity and ranges of 430 and 629 km. It stands out for its overall balance, good performance, price, power and a spacious cabin with good rear seats and a large trunk. Interesting Solarbay system and steering wheel paddles. Improved rear visibility and charging capacity at high power.
Toyota C-HR
It improves some aspects of the previous generation, such as the cabin design, the finish and the mechanical offer, now with an interesting plug-in hybrid that promises more than 60 km of electric range. The behavior is good in general and consumption in the city stands out at it is above average, although on the road it rises disproportionately. The noise level is still somewhat high when driving fast.
Volvo EX30
Very interesting concept for urban use, but disproportionate in terms of power, since it is offered in electric variants of 272 and 428 hp and contained prices. Interior excessively simple, with all instrumentation entrusted to a central screen with small graphics, without physical controls. Rear seats are very limited in terms of space and improvable autonomy. It announces recharging power above 130 kW, although we have not had the opportunity to check it."
,Pedro Martín,5,7,6,2,1,1,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/pedro-martin.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Except for the unnecessary increase in length, which takes it beyond five meters, little criticism deserves the BMW sedan, a solid, comfortable, safe and technological car, with the usual effective and sporty behavior of the brand, two bodies to choose from and mechanics of all kinds: very efficient diesel, plug-in hybrids and the excellent i5 versions.
BYD Seal
It is the first car of a Chinese manufacturer to enter the final, and it is not by chance. Because the Seal is the most advanced product of a brand that stands out for its quality and electrical technology, with examples such as the Blade battery. But it does not offer a long range and its consumption is not low, it has a recharge power only correct and its air conditioning can be improved.
Kia EV9
The Korean SUV is very large and has a high price, a type of vehicle that adapts to very few users. And it is only electric, although with a first-class technology, because it is the one that recharges energy at the highest speed and equips several kinds of bidirectional charging. Spacious, comfortable, fast, ergonomic... If it were a car with a more popular focus, it would give you more points.
Peugeot 3008
Like BMW, Peugeot is committed to a multi-energy vehicle, the ideal solution for this transition stage. The French SUV, which debuts a modern interior with some debatable design solution, will have MHEV hybrids, plug-in hybrids and the electric E-3008, these with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, and up to 700 kilometers of range. And although it's not light, it's efficient.
Renault Scenic
If we were choosing the 'electric car of the year', the Scenic would be my favorite, because Renault has done a great job: large interior space in a compact body, rational driving position, effective dynamic behavior, good performance, high overall quality... But it is only electric, and although it is very light, the consumption is not low. And the recharge, only correct.
Toyota C-HR
The Toyota C-HR can be accused of being conservative compared to the previous one. But its evolution has been the necessary: more modern driving position, better rear seats, wider trunk and new plug-in hybrid version with a lot of electrical activity and remarkable efficiency, in line with the HEV hybrids. Of these, 200H is better than 140H.
Volvo EX30
The Swedish brand enters a new segment: the SUV-B. And it does it with an avant-garde and reasonably priced car, which makes it the cheapest Volvo despite being electric. It has quality and is comfortable and pleasant in daily use, but I don't like the driving position, because it generates distractions, and the rear seats are fair. The basic version has 272 hp: excessive power."
,Juan Ignacio Eguiara,7,6,5,2,2,1,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/juan-ignacio-eguiara.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
The eighth generation is a mature product and the best 5-series in history. Its mechanical and body variety make it the most complete car of all the finalists. Electric, diesel or gasoline versions; saloon or estate; for every taste. It is not a car for everyone, but its price is more than reasonable for the high level of quality. Without a doubt one of my favorites this year.
BYD Seal
His entry among the finalists was a surprise. He arrives from China with strength but still has a long way to go to reach the quality standards of European manufacturers. A body for a very restricted audience and with a small trunk. A lot of power but little usable. And its quality of finish inside can be improved and the interactivity with the screen too.
Kia EV9
A spectacular technological exercise. It is a very exclusive car that prevents it from being able to get more points. Impressive interior, habitability and equipment, as well as a chassis that surprises with its stability despite its enormous size and weight. Consumption too high.
Peugeot 3008
High level of quality and a wide mechanical offer that adapts to the needs of the segment in which it operates. An SUV that offers an excellent electric vehicle that already has very high ranges, which the public demands. Its i-cockpit driving position is excellent, although the gear shift knob has an impractical location on the dashboard. Fair habitability for the rear seats and correct trunk.
Renault Scenic
My favorite without a doubt. The best compact SUV in the category, due to its excellent use of space. At just over 4 meters long, you get perfect rear seats and an impressive trunk. It is an electric vehicle with great autonomy with very tight consumption.
Toyota C-HR
This new generation is still a good product. The small 140H version is too limited in terms of performance and with a slightly high sound and noise level. The plug-in hybrid version is excellent and its finish offers the brand's guarantee of longevity. Attractive design but leaves a cabin that is not very functional and with the entrance through the rear doors very tight.
Volvo EX30
It represents the democratization of electric cars in the market with already very reasonable and competitive prices. A risky product offering a minimalist appearance as we had not seen in a car of this category until now. Size between compact and utilitarian that has too little habitability. The chassis is more designed for urban and interurban use."
,Xavier Pérez,8,5,5,3,1,1,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/xavier-perez.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
This is the most complete car of the seven finalists because it has all the propulsion technologies. I was impressed by the diesel engine. The engine offer is excellent, with very good dynamic performance. The technological equipment is very good, functional and with a great visual quality. Easy and fun to drive. Good interior space for both front and rear seats. Excellent trunk and a very attractive design. Although it is a sedan, it offers very good sensations. The 100% electric option is one of the best of the seven finalists.
BYD Seal
The Chinese brand BYD debuts in the European market and enters the final of the Car Of The Year in its first opportunity. Good news. Good presentation in general, with special care in the interior details. But some materials are not very elegant, with hard plastics that do not offer the premium image intended by the brand. The 100% electric motor has very good performance. The suspension is somewhat soft, and the infotainment system is often a bit complex to handle.
Kia EV9
For its design it deserves a separate category because it is a very special car. It is excellent in performance, even in road dynamism. Its size makes it too heavy, although it is more agile than it looks. Very good equipment. The range is good, but the consumption is too high (penalizes him for his weight and size). Good materials and functionality of the multimedia system. It is a good car but not to be chosen as the best of the seven finalists.
Peugeot 3008
Peugeot has done a very good job with this SUV. The design is modern, although it has lost some of the styling risk of previous generations. Inside I find it small, with little space in the rear seats despite having a platform that would allow something more. The driving position is good, but I don't like the feeling of being trapped between the center console and the steering wheel. The evolved i-cockpit improves on previous generations. Very good solution with the i-toggles. The engine offer seems excellent to me, with all the options available. The 100% electric version is very good in terms of performance and dynamics. Good consumptions.
Renault Scenic
This model represents very well the new philosophy of the French brand. In the Scenic changes everything except the name. Its design is modern and elegant. It is not strident. It is a 100% electric car, which represents a very important evolution compared to the Renault Mégane that was a finalist a couple of years ago. Very good dynamism and performance. Very good response on curvy roads and motorways. Consumption is not excessively high and the range is very good. The interior space is excellent in all seats, comfortable and with very good materials inside. The infotainment system is not complicated to use. For me it is the best car of the seven finalists, if we consider all parameters, including a sensible price for the customer.
Toyota C-HR
Toyota has made a very basic car. Its dynamic performance is not outstanding. Its design is modern and is quite radical. That makes that some customers do not end up entering into its orbit. Its first generation was already a finalist and that means it is a car that can be popular. The smaller conventional hybrid version in power does not improve too much the previous one, but the version with plug-in hybrid engine improves a lot the offer in the range. Its interior is not very large, could have a little more legroom in the rear seats. By price it is the most affordable of all finalists.
Volvo EX30
The Swedish brand has made a compact, fast, agile car with very good dynamic performance. The design is modern and stylish. It picks up some elements of the Volvo XC40, winner of the Car Of The Year in 2017. The price is not high, and it is very well thought out for the European market. The interior is very clean, too much so. I miss a screen in front of the driver. You have to take your eyes off the road for any detail, as everything goes through the central screen. The exterior mirror control system is not useful either."
,Pere Prat,7,5,5,5,1,1,1,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/pere-prat.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
The German brand proves that the three-volume bodywork allows considerable energy savings compared to any SUV. This automobile inherits the traditional sportive temperament which BMW has defended through its history and outstands both for its material quality and its dynamic refinement.
BYD Seal
The Chinese manufacturers, which are starting to gain prominence in the European market, are betting decidedly for the electric models. The BYD Seal is a magnificent example of common sense applied to its software in order to put it at the driver's service. The narrow access to the trunk makes it difficult to transfer the baggage.
Kia EV9
The good time of the Korean brands is manifested through this model, which dares to propose new reference motives for the large size SUV segment. The Kia EV9 puts the level 3 of autonomous driving into the market, which will soon allow to drive without the obligation of grabbing the wheel with the hands in many countries.
Peugeot 3008
The passage of time is proving the responsibles of the French brand right, who have been betting for elevated instrumentation. The panoramic i-Cockpit from the Peugeot 3008 is a powerful sales argument. With a homologated range of 700 kilometres, the electric gamma puts an end to the fear of the customer for the autonomy.
Renault Scenic
In order to dispose of a good aerodynamic coefficient, Renault has decided to bet for a moderated height bodywork. Designed to succeed in Europe, the new Scenic shines for its polyvalence of use. Ideal to move through the city and travel with the family, it offers the advanced Google assistant as a positive differential factor.
Toyota C-HR
Without losing its own vanguardist personality of the previous version, the new generation bodywork has a more elegant design, with the objective of broadening its clients' base. The arrival of PHEV technology means an interesting added value to the gamma, even though the new hybridization was expected to be more silent.
Volvo EX30
As a surprise, Volvo proves that currently the electric automation can compete with combustion engines in terms of price. With a simple design, destined to endure the passing of the years, the EX30 has a gamma composed by two batteries and two engines. The superior version has the acceleration high score for the brand."
Sweden,Jan-Erik Berggren,2,10,1,6,4,2,0,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/jan-erik-berggren.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
I'm not only impressed with the powertrain and the execution of BMW's electric 5-series but also of the handling and driving performance. Once again BMW proved they are among the best there is to develop suspension and chassis. The complete 5-series is once again one of the best car to buy and own. By far my Car of the Year 2024.
BYD Seal
The first Chinese brand in the final 7 proves to be a pretty good electric package. The compact power train and the safe high voltage blade battery brings something new to the car industry. But what happened with the AWD-system? Not working in our test.
Kia EV9
To win one year and come back with a true contender and a finalist the year after is impressive. EV9 is the best package for the big family in Europe and low running cost due to safe and proven technology make this to a safe buy even if the initial price is high. Kia built a really big car that feels small in my sensitive hands - I like that very much.
Peugeot 3008
The first true electric platform from Stellantis group but it contains a combustion engine. Maybe Peugeot good have done even more if the really concentrated on building a true electric car. A little to ""boxy"" and stiff for my taste when it comes to handling. The performance is good but I really expected a little bit more from a platform that's going to stay around for a while.
Renault Scenic
A very good family car with good performance and good range. But I lack a little technical innovation. We have seen this before so even if its good and good value for money its a little bit down on my list and outside my clear top-three. And why is the third lever still there to the right? Didnt we agree 10 years ago that this was a bad choice?
Toyota C-HR
A good second generation of a big sales success for Toyota. And an improvement. But for me this is the wrong Toyota in the final. Prius was my choice. And why dont put the best gearbox in C-HR? I also think the Car of the Year needs a functional second row.
Volvo EX30
And speaking of second row. The Volvo is a little bit to small in the second row. Volvo came up with some new innovations in this car - the soundbar is one - and some new material but main focus has been on low production cost. Maybe they aimed a little to ""low"" because we miss the Volvo we knew about. The front seat is one big issue for me - I cry a bit because it used to be so good."
,Carl-Johan Lejland,1,9,2,8,3,1,1,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/carl-johan-lejland.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
It's a signal of strength to be able to build such a good car as this. Regardless of it's drivetrain the new 5-Serie is very good to drive, and clearly the best in this year's final. And the i5 is one of the absolute best and most comfortable electric cars to drive. BMW's strategy shows that the talk of the need for a dedicated BEV-platforms is overstated.
BYD Seal
BYD is a real powerhouse in electrification with both battery- and vehicle-production, and it shows. The Seal is comfortable with good driving characteristics. The AWD-version is quick as a rocket, but the chassis can handle all the power in a sophisticated manner, which shows improvement compared to other BYD models. This is the first BYD in the final, but most probably not the last.
Kia EV9
Bigger and better. The Kia EV9 is quiet, comfortable and has a lot of room inside for every user case, with superb seats. And whats more, the E-GMP platform makes the charging quick and the range quite good. For what it can offer and at this price point the Kia EV9 has no clear competitor.
Peugeot 3008
With a range of up to 700 km the new E-3008 is a clear indication on the rapid development of electric cars. The company strategy that also makes it possible to offer a wide range of drivetrain options is another strength, since the speed of adoption of BEV:s is very different in different markets. The driver now has a better view over the instruments and the ride comfort is good.
Renault Scenic
Long range and good interior space for it's class. The new Scenic is a good option for anyone looking to take the step to a pure electric car. The operating system from Google is easy to use, but the interior is somewhat cluttered with buttons and levers. An overall good car, but not the best this year.
Toyota C-HR
Toyota has been making hybrids since the 1990's and with constant development they are getting better and better. The C-HR benefits from options such as PHEV and AWD, and a more lively driving experience. This model is also the one with the lowest price tag in the final, but the buyers will get a really solid vehicle. Especially for people not able to buy an EV.
Volvo EX30
The smallest car from Volvo Cars in quite a while is a fun and nicely designed car with an exciting interior thanks to new materials. The entry price is good, and the EX30 will likely find many customers in big cities. The model brings a nice Volvo-feel to the small car segment. The very modern instrumentation, with only one screen, and lack of interior space will limit its appeal."
,Tommy Wahlström,4,7,1,10,3,0,0,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/tommy-wahlstrom.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
BMW's prowess in manufacturing large, speedy sedans with high comfort and fine driving experience is well-known, but the i5 model does this as an electric vehicle. The Touring estate variant presents a new blend of cargo capacity and electric propulsion in the premium segment.
BYD Seal
For the first time, a Chinese car manufacturer has reached the finals in Car of the Year. The Seal model offers fine performance and matches its competitors in terms of technology level. The Blade battery enhances safety.
Kia EV9
The Kia EV9 stands apart with its blend of spaciousness, advanced technology, and fast-charging capability at a somewhat reasonable price. The EV9 is a large SUV equipped with all-wheel drive, 800-volt technology, a towing capacity of 2.5 tons, and seating for up to seven. These features have the potential to attract a new segment of customers who previously did not consider an electric vehicle within their reach.
Peugeot 3008
The new 3008 competes with advanced design and innovative technology, where the latest version of the i-Cockpit is particularly notable. Low consumption and the option to choose a battery with high capacity give the electric version a class-leading range of up to 700 km.
Renault Scenic
Generous space and a range of over 600 km make the new Scenic an intriguing interpretation of the European family car. High-tech levels, yet thanks to Google's infotainment system, it remains straightforward to use.
Toyota C-HR
The C-HR model has matured, offering increased comfort and more equipment without losing the innovative design of the previous generation. Toyota elevates the level of electrification with the plug-in hybrid version, which has a 60 km range on electric power alone.
Volvo EX30
The EX30 signifies a shift in Volvo's core philosophy, prioritising performance, environmental considerations, and affordability over space and family-friendliness. With this model, an electric SUV in a smaller format is offered, thus reaching new customer groups."
Switzerland,Ramon Egger,5,8,2,3,2,2,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/ramon-egger.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
The BMW 5-series offers a wide range of drivetrains, such as gasoline, diesel, hybrid and electric and with the i5 Touring even an electric station-wagon. It has an impressive quality and smooth driving, but it is a bit pricey.
BYD Seal
With its powerful electric motor the all-electric BYD Seal offers sporty driving with a lot of oversteer. It's almost too much for the daily driver. UI/UX has some serious flaws such as no navigation instructions in instrument cluster or head-up display.
Kia EV9
The Kia EV9 is one of the few electric 7-seater and offers a lot of space. For some customers it might be even too big, which puts this car in a niche. Despite its size and weight, the handling is quite impressive. Short charging time and good range is a plus.
Peugeot 3008
The range of the Peugeot E-3008 is impressive, the interior is nice and roomy. But the car feels too heavy and thus handling is sub-par and lacks the punch expected from an electric car.
Renault Scenic
The Renault Scenic might be the best choice for anyone looking for a compact fully electric SUV. Handling is quite well, the car surprisingly light and the range is good. UI with Android Automotive is among the best. Big effort in sustainability with many recycled materials.
Toyota C-HR
For the majority of customers, gasoline cars are still the preferred choice. The Toyota C-HR offers efficient hybrid drivetrains including four-wheel drive, although some engines lack of punch. Functionality of voice commands is very limited.
Volvo EX30
The Twin Engine version of the Volvo EX30 offers a lot of power for a small SUV, but range is very limited. The interior feels cheap and space is small, compared to the size of the car. The biggest flaw is the weak UI."
,Andreas Faust,5,7,1,4,1,4,3,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/andreas-faust.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
No, this is not a reasonably priced car for the average customer. But if one keeps in mind the advanced technology, a full range of drivetrains from salesman's diesel to technophile's high performance EV version, the sporty driving dynamics, the least annoying ADAS and two body styles without any compromises, this is the best of 2024. Even if its not the cheapest.
BYD Seal
Surprise, surprise: BYD's sporty EV limousine is up to rest of the 2024 bunch with sharp driving dynamics - maybe even way too sharp - and a quality interior. But there are no surprises in connectivity, an annoying ADAS system und poor trunk space as well.
Kia EV9
Family goes electric: With ample space, bold design, even a touch of premium and nimble handling for such a big car, this is the EV-SUV-Van-revolution some customers might have hoped for. But technology-wise it is more evolution.
Peugeot 3008
Bold, characteristic design, a welcoming cockpit with straight-forward operation and a beautifully crafted interior set a new level for Peugeot. But the ICE-version feels strained and the electric drivetrain a little bit stiff around the hips for a new-generation EV - the upcoming AWD-EV might do better. And why is it that heavy?
Renault Scenic
This is Megane E-Tech even better: Still lightweight construction, reasonably sized battery, well-balanced driving dynamics, but with more space in the back and the trunk. And still affordable for families. Lets hope the polymer liquid crystal panoramic roof will keep summer heat out like an old-school louvre. And please think again about driver's right knee and the center stack.
Toyota C-HR
A piece of design to show off in the neighborhood, fun to drive and with a well-crafted interior - this is the compact car one needs if one still doesn't want to charge, but to save fuel as well. More evolution than revolution, but one of the best affordable ICE-only cars in recent years.
Volvo EX30
This is the small, lovely and even reasonably priced EV-SUV customers have been waiting for for years: Beautifully designed, sporty to drive (even the RWD-version), cool scandinavian. But hej - you are Volvo, THE car brand for safety: You cannot do a 428-hp-car with a speedometer the size of a kitchen oven's clock just for cost. And please a bit more premium feel in the interior."
,Simon Tottoli,5,3,3,3,1,4,6,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/simon-tottoli.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Excellent driving characteristics with great handling, good steering and a good mix of sportiness (plenty) and comfort (enough). Wide range of powertrains. A typical BMW, just how customers want it. However, the pricing is also typical of the brand; the car is expensive, as are the equipment options. In addition, the dimensions are very extending, which can be problematic, especially in the city.
BYD Seal
Offers a lot of driving fun thanks to the sporty suspension set-up, direct steering and plenty of power. However, the assistants overdo it a little with their warnings. Innovative in terms of battery technology and design. Very good spaciousness for passengers. Quality and finish at a good level, but there is a faint smell of plastic. Very interesting price-performance ratio.
Kia EV9
Extremely spacious and flexible, driving behavior is impressive for this size. The high weight is not very noticeable, except at the charging station, as the power consumption is rather high. In addition, the exterior dimensions are simply too expansive by European standards, even if they are at least converted into a feudal amount of space.
Peugeot 3008
The interior concept impresses with a good feeling of spaciousness and appealing materials. In addition, the i-Cockpit, which is typical of the brand, is excellently realized and should suit the vast majority of drivers. More than adequate driving performance and moderate power consumption in the electric version. The driving behavior is somewhat disappointing, as the car handles safely, but somewhat sluggishly through bends.
Renault Scenic
Well-done reinterpretation of the family van in crossover form with electric drive. Enough space with tolerable exterior dimensions. Good handling, which is almost a touch too sporty for such a vehicle. However, the suspension and steering set-up is fundamentally great. The biggest flaw: depending on the size of the driver, the centre console can press uncomfortably on the knee.
Toyota C-HR
The model doesn't do much wrong, it is available in various fuel-efficient drive combinations including full hybrid, plug-in hybrid and all-wheel drive, has a reasonable amount of space with compact dimensions and offers reasonable operability despite some experimentation in the cockpit. The hybrid drives all work very well. The only pity is that there is no PHEV-4WD combination.
Volvo EX30
The smallest Volvo would actually be a real joy. It is very pleasant to drive, has enough space despite its compact dimensions and looks good. But the materials in the interior are really very basic. The fact that they are sustainable is no excuse; other brands look better. What's more, the infotainment system doesn't work as well as you would expect from Google."
Turkey,Ufuk Sandik,9,1,5,1,1,7,1,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/ufuk-sandik.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
The car has a refined design. I especially like the details in the interior design, for example the touch buttons. The interior design is very stylish. Handling and driving comfort are at a high level as in every BMW model. The spaciousness of the interior is remarkable. In terms of price/performance, it is not very good. Overall, I liked it, when I compared it to the other finalists, I didn't find it enough to be the ""Car of the Year.
BYD Seal
Chinese brand BYD has entered Europe with competitive prices. While many brands offer optional equipment, Seal offers such equipment as standard in its entry-level equipment. In this way, it stands out with its competitive price. It is important to develop and produce its own battery. Blade Battery technology makes Seal stand out. BYD designers focused not only on performance but also on passenger comfort.
Kia EV9
In recent years, we have started to see Kia frequently among the top 7 finalists. The brand, which is assertive in the electric car market, stands out with the EV9. The giant SUV stands out among the other finalists with its distinct design. It stands out with its spacious interior and the comfort it offers. EV9 feels like a premium brand car. However, when I compared it to the other finalists, I realized that it was not enough for the ""Car of the Year"".
Peugeot 3008
I like the brand's recent design language and I also like the 3008's pretentious exterior appearance. The car's interior design is even better. The cockpit designed driver-oriented and this layout allows the driver to control the car without taking his/her eyes off the road. The high material quality makes the car feel like a upper segment model. Offering different engine alternatives is also a good strategy.
Renault Scenic
Renault Scenic is my favorite car this year. I like the brand's recent design language. Both the exterior and interior design of Scenic is quite ambitious. The quality of the materials used in the interior is high. All these things raise the quality perception of Scenic. Renault has developed a vehicle that can compete with both electric SUVs and ICE SUVs. It is completely a family car.
Toyota C-HR
The problems found in the previous generation Toyota C-HR have been partially resolved. The designers have taken consumer complaints into account. Headroom in the rear seats has been improved. In this way, the situation that triggers claustrophobia in the back has been remedied to some extent. I liked the exterior design very much, but I can't say the same for the interior design. The care in the exterior design could have been inside as well.
Volvo EX30
I like the simple design of Volvo's compact SUV EX30. The simple design continues inside the vehicle. Especially in recent electric cars, it is very good that there are no confusing screens. However, the lack of an instrument display or head up display is a shortcoming. The driver following the multimedia screen positioned in the center console prevents safe driving."
United Kingdom,Andrew English,8,4,0,1,3,4,5,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/andrew-english.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
Very grand and the top models have an unearthly ride quality, but the battery electric efficiency isn't great and it's really big, heavy and expensive.
BYD Seal
Terrific opener for this Chinese company and the LFP technology is class leading even if the charge rates are lowish. Ride and handling isn't bad either and as a Tesla beater, it's very credible, but it lacks a bit of polish.
Kia EV9
Strangely likeable but huge and not desperately efficient. If the argument for a battery electric seven-seat off roader is acceptable in some parts of Europe, then what is the purpose of the five-seat, front-drive version?
Peugeot 3008
Good to look at, but the framing is from a bigger car and so it's carrying a lot of extra weight and is therefore entering this highly competitive arena with one wheel in a sling
Renault Scenic
Not perfect by any means, but a logical and efficient way of transporting a family with a decent battery electric range and competitive prices. Ride and handling are pretty good, too, though the boot is a funny shape and difficult to access.
Toyota C-HR
One of the few petrol hybrids in the short list and all the better for it. The smaller engined hybrids are fairly miserable to drive, though and while the plug in hybrid is the best of the bunch, it's also the most expensive.
Volvo EX30
The car you want to love, but it's full of contradictions. Dynamically sound with a decent ride quality, but does a city Volvo really need such rip-snorting acceleration? Also the safety and distraction concerns about the single centre touch screen are too strong to give this full marks."
,Andrew Frankel,5,4,3,6,2,3,2,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/andrew-frankel.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
This is largely what you might expect an electric 5-series to be. It's very sophisticated and, by EV standards, notably driver oriented thanks to both variants on sale offering keen handing, accurate steering and impressive power delivery. Sharing its platform with the 7-series means a fine ride too. But it is incredibly expensive and its range and charging speeds are entirely unremarkable. BMW will need to try harder in these areas if the 5-series is to maintain its long held position as the most desirable car in its category
BYD Seal
BYD's first shortlisted contender should come as a rude wake up call to the global automotive establishment, for while the Seal is undoubtedly flawed, it is let down only in the detail because the fundamentals are highly impressive. These include good looks, excellent performance, 800 volt electrical infrastructure for rapid charging and a spacious interior. But quality is a little variable, the infotainment system is hard to understand and operate and the driving safety systems too intrusive.
Kia EV9
Dramatic looking cars are increasingly common these days. EV architecture has provided designers with freedoms they've not enjoyed for years. But all too often, noteworthy styling is being used to cover up cars which are often pretty disappointing beneath those sharp-looking suits they wear. By contrast, the EV9 not only looks great, it then goes on to deliver in full on the promise of that appearance. It's incredibly spacious, easy to operate, offers superb range and rapid charging. It's far from cheap, but among EVs at least, it's more than worth the extra.
Peugeot 3008
It is incredible to see how far Peugeot has come in recent times, and if construction quality and perceived luxury were the only determinants here, the E-3008 would be even further up my order. This is a fine place to pass the time, aided by a silken ride quality and hushed refinement. Only two issues really hold it back: its premium pricing and its weight. At over 2.1 tonnes it is hundreds of kilogrammes heavier than the Scenic, blunting its handling and damaging its environmental credentials.
Renault Scenic
A new EV that builds further on the promise of the Megane whose platform it shares. Clean design melds with clever features - for example customisable toggles that provide instant access to the functions you use the most - a roomy interior and decent driving dynamics. A more flexible cabin with sliding, reclining rear seats would be welcome but I appreciated Renault's efforts to minimise weight to improve range and dynamics and, in the UK at least, keen pricing to make extremely competitive.
Toyota C-HR
Even though it is available only as a conventional hybrid and a plug in, the C-HR is typical of the trend in modern car design which prioritises style over ability. This is a dramatic and fine looking body concealing what is in dynamic terms a rather ordinary car whose case is not helped at all by its unlovable CVT transmission. For those considering a C-HR, the plug-in version, with more power, torque and over 40 miles of EV range is a dramatically better option, and were it here on its own, would doubtless have resulted in a considerably higher placing.
Volvo EX30
There's so much to like about this new Volvo: its looks, interior, the best blend of ride and handling in the category, and the sense of quality that goes with it. So why the lowly position? Because of the way vital information is accessed and displayed. You have to take your eyes off the road even to see how fast you're going, and dig into sub menus for functions as basic and vital as fog lights. For any car to require you to spend so much time not looking where you are going would be unwise, for a Volvo it is frankly bizarre."
,Paul Horrell,8,9,2,2,3,0,1,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/paul-horrell.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
This is a great car to drive or ride in. The suspension and steering are superb, especially the adaptive version with four-wheel steering, which imparts immense spread between comfort and sportiness. The broad range of powertrains are all excellent in their class. The control interface works well once you're used to it. I think the design is brash, but this is the world's best saloon.
BYD Seal
It looks good and is well specified, so makes a strong market entry. The advanced electric system and cobalt-free battery are commendable too, and it's enjoyable enough to drive quickly. That's undermined by an agitated ride over bumps, and the logic of screens and switches is pretty eccentric. BYD is moving fast and I'm sure the revised version will have its rough edges polished away. But not yet.
Kia EV9
Immense space and good versatility make this an enviable wagon for a big family. The looks mean they'll be noticed on arrival too. Driver ergonomics are well-thought-out. The long wheelbase is good for space, but there's no four-wheel steering and that makes it very cumbersome around town junctions. The size and mass mean it uses a lot of electricity but at least it charges fast.
Peugeot 3008
The interior design and interface are terrific, a first impression that will give lasting pleasure. The choice between electric and combustion is well-conceived. But it's too heavy, and feels that way to drive, lacking Peugeot's usual vivacity. Yes, it's very quiet and the optional big battery will make headlines but overall I expected better from a brand-new platform.
Renault Scenic
There's space for five and useful versatility, even if it doesn't have some of the original Scenic tricks (which few actually used). The design is agreeable outside and well-furnished inside. It's good to drive, with an agility helped by the well-contained mass. Impressive electric range too. It's the best normal-priced family car on sale, so it gets big points from me.
Toyota C-HR
The coupe styling is a big draw, yet it will accommodate medium-size rear passengers with only moderate compromise. Economy is strong of course. The plug-in version's extra electrical torque improves acceleration refinement, but the non-plug one still drones a lot. Steering is fine but the suspension is a little noisy. It's the cheapest car on the shortlist but I'm afraid it feels it.
Volvo EX30
The sustainability story is strong, especially in the version with the LFP battery. Recycled materials don't undermine the cabin's striking beauty either. I like the steering, and progressive performance of the single-motor version. The twin-motor is OTT. But saving cost and materials by throwing out the switches is a mistake. This is a pleasant car to drive but much too difficult to operate."
,Phil McNamara,7,3,1,8,4,2,0,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/phil-mcnamara.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
The 5-series range sweeps from pure electric to punchy plug-in hybrids to four-cylinder petrol, offering something for everyone - except UK diesel lovers which is a shame. The base i5 has a beautifully cushy, at times floaty ride and is sweetly refined - keen drivers will need the �2400 adaptive dampers on top of the �75,005 car. The ballistic M60 is every inch a sporty BMW. Personally I find the cockpit chintzy, BMW's apps page unfathomable and the shared platform means a transmission tunnel impinges on electric version's rear space.
BYD Seal
What a 2023 for BYD: overtaking Tesla to become the world's biggest EV maker in Q4, and launching three new EVs in Europe. The Seal is the most polished, with a good quality, spacious cockpit (complete with rear flat floor) and a refined, relaxed air on the road. It's absolutely dripping with equipment including a comprehensive safety suite which contributes to a 5-star Euro NCAP rating (like the Kia and BMW). The snag is that the base Tesla is much cheaper and the Long Range Model 3 only �1295 more expensive for a better driving car.
Kia EV9
The EV9 is the world's best seven seat electric car, or pay more for less: the six-seat combination, with its central gangway, has the distinct air of private jet travel. Sure, a vehicle of this size and weight isn't efficient (just 2.5 miles per kWh for the AWD on our recent efficiency test, compared with 3.1 miles for the RWD i5 saloon) but what do you expect? Thankfully the e-GMP platform recharges quickly (210 kW max DC charging). It rides well, there's a logical mix of physical and digital controls but the safety systems are intrusive, particularly the driver monitoring system which is a distracting hazard. �65,000 in the UK for a Kia?! That's a steal compared with a Mercedes EQV or the upcoming electric Range Rover. The EV9's an automotive rock star and my 2024 Car of the Year.
Peugeot 3008
Let's start with the good stuff: the E-3008's exterior looks sensationally sharp, it's hugely desirable on the inside too and it rides comfortably and quietly. But there's not that much space in the rear (despite being bigger than the Renault), it's 234 kg heavier and that weight affects the handling. The 73kWh E-3008 doesn't go as far as the base Scenic and costs more both outright and on a 48-month lease. The Peugeot will wow plenty with its style but the Scenic is a better all-rounder.
Renault Scenic
There are a lot of midsize electric crossovers but the keenly priced Scenic is one of the very best. It's a triumph of design: lots of space (including a 545 litre trunk) in a compact package and commendably light: just 1850 kg for the 87 kWh bigger battery version we get in the UK. That means a decent range: up to 385 miles (officially) and 3.7 miles per kWh efficiency. It handles nimbly and has some lovely humancentric touches: a rear armrest with built-in tablet holders, a clever glass roof, fun family apps and a high quality interior operated by sophisticated Google OS voice control. The Scenic gets an extra point for walking the walk on sustainability too.
Toyota C-HR
On our Silverstone test day, the C-HR was the least refined car, with lots of tyre rumble at dual-carriageway speeds and an unsettled ride. And while the hybrid powertrain effortlessly delivers you decent economy (57.6mpg officially), it can be hesitant and noisy. There's not much space in the rear (admittedly it's a compact 4362mm-long). If you want the latest Toyota, consider the sophisticated new Prius instead.
Volvo EX30
Aesthetes will swoon at Volvo's EX30: it's packed with lovely design touches include floating arm rests, a chunky cube for seat adjustment, sleek air vents, denim upholstery and lots of secondlife materials. The UK entry price is an eye-catching �33,795 for a well-equipped car with lots of safety kit, although this translates into a similar monthly lease rate to the E-3008 and Scenic. Thankfully the quick and sweet driving rear-drive car is all you need (simply pick big or small battery) because the costlier, over-powered, clumsily suspended AWD model is a mess to drive. Volvo has gone too far in putting all the controls on the touchscreen: Renault and Kia have a better balance of physical and digital switchgear. The EX30 is a bit too small for family use, but if Volvo can repeat this formula in a midsize car it'll be onto a winner."
,Vicky Parrott,5,4,0,6,8,2,0,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/vicky-parrott.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
The BMW 5-series is a brilliant example of executive tech, and I chose to give it points particularly as it has managed to set the benchmark for ride and handling - including in the i5 eDrive40 as well as the 520d and the PHEV 550i that I drove. The interior finish, powertrains and dynamics are all fabulous. I don't love the way it looks, and I don't extend my comments on the dynamics to the iDrive M60, which I actually find disappointing - especially given the cost. If the M60 were anywhere even close to the Taycan (a similar price, after all) on what it delivers, I would have given the 5-series far more points if not the overall win. As it is, the lower end models that most will buy are proof that BMW still knows how to make the finest driving execs.
BYD Seal
The BYD Seal is great to drive and has class-leading battery technology, but I'd like to have seen more compelling finance offers and list prices - at least from launch - to overcome the uncertainty of a new brand. I believe that could be done without eroding the company's premium standing, at this stage. The interior is a little quirky in some design aspects for European tastes, too, if decent in terms of perceived material quality.
Kia EV9
I rate the Kia EV9 very highly as it brings such huge practicality and seven/six-seat flexibility to the pure electric classes; something that nothing else short of the Tesla Model X has managed, and the Kia is in a class of its own at the prices involved. I have only chosen to give first place to the Volvo as the Kia finance costs are high in the UK, and I have not seen great efficiency from it on the road. Even so, it's no doubt a great car that - in the context of plush, full-size seven-seaters - represents good value.
Peugeot 3008
I like the looks and interior of the Peugeot, and the warranty and range are really very good, but the price is high compared to rivals like the Scenic and Tesla Model Y, and rear passenger space isn't quite what I'd want it to be for a car of this size. It's a very good car that I have no doubt will sell well, but I don't feel that it brings enough new here to warrant being Car of the Year.
Renault Scenic
The Scenic has a great driving range and really excellent standard equipment levels for the price, plus the Google infotainment is great and the material finish around the cabin very impressive. PCP contract prices are very fair in the UK, too. I've also found it reasonably efficient in the real-world, albeit I'd like more time to really confirm that. If it'd had a more practical boot shape, I likely would have seriously considered this for the overall win, but the short, deep boot is very impractical for quite a few family motorists. Even so, it's a really excellent electric family car that deserves to do well in this year's award.
Toyota C-HR
It's not hard to see why the Toyota C-HR is popular, and the plug-in hybrid variant is a good new addition, but I feel that the range is poorer for the absence of an all-electric version as well. More than that, it still feels cramped in the back seats and, while I don't dislike the standard 'self-charging' hybrid powertrain, there's very little that I particularly enjoy about it, either. It's a very worthy and recommendable, efficient family crossover, but it doesn't really feel like a new model so much as a facelift to me, and other contenders here feel more modern and advanced.
Volvo EX30
The Volvo EX30 is my winner because it represents great value, it's fun to drive, and feels modern and fresh. It is not flawless and I agree with others that the touchscreen layout is poorly thought out in areas. I hope for improvements on that with the software updates that have been promised. Even so, the Volvo EX30 is a great price for a premium-badged product, and is an interesting, well-executed electric car that feels like it's offering something different and appealing for buyers shopping in a very crowded class of family hatches and crossovers."
,Mark Tisshaw,5,5,2,6,1,2,4,https://www.caroftheyear.org/votaciones/mark-tisshaw.php?1726491866,"My judgement is based on following grounds:
BMW 5-series
I wasn't overly enamoured with the electric i5, which felt a bit lost in positioning between the i4 and i7. However, when broadened out to the range as a whole, the proposition becomes far more compelling. This 5-series is the best example yet of the multi-energy platform in action that means there's a version for everyone. Great to see diesel still offered and the plug-in hybrids are superb.
BYD Seal
An impressive first attempt at an executive saloon from BYD, and it ticks lots of rational boxes. Interior quality is good, it drives well and it's efficient. You'd be very happy to do lots of miles in one. Its score is simply limited by how derivative it is and how little it brings to the market that isn't already available elsewhere.
Kia EV9
The field is very close at the top this year, with no one truly outstanding candidate, rather a series of models with very specific qualities in their chosen segments. The EV9 is the one truly original car here, which gives it the edge for me. It's a fresh, modern take on the large family car with a nice relaxed drive and a hugely practical interior. Single-motor version is the one to go for.
Peugeot 3008
Pound for pound, the 3008 has the best interior here. It's a new benchmark in the mainstream market. Yet the rest of the package isn't as impressive as the rest of the cars on the shortlist, chiefly the driving dynamics. The car is simply too heavy and this limits performance and the ride and handling.
Renault Scenic
A good electric family car. Doesn't move the game on too much but does feel like a good evolution and refining of the breed. Rides and handles well in the UK, which is why it's placed so far ahead of the conceptually similar 3008 in my book. Some clever touches, such as the range indicator showing best- and worst-case scenarios. No need to go for the sporty Esprit Alpine, which hurts the ride.
Toyota C-HR
Fantastic styling gives it real kerb appeal and there's a good variety of powertrains, too. One of the more dynamic small crossovers to drive, which is another big plus. However, it's too pricey and not spacious enough. Above all else, though, it feels like a simple refining and reskinning of the already impressive original car, rather than a revolution.
Volvo EX30
A curious car. It looks fantastic and breaks new ground for its maker, which should always be applauded and is why it gets at least one point. The dual-motor version has too much power for the chassis, so just stick to the single-motor. What can't be overlooked is just how poor the infotainment user experience is. For a safety-conscious company, such distracting technology is almost unforgivable."
